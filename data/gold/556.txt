The activity of DPM-DC was measured fluorometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that autofluoresce under these conditions. Despite using a kinetic assay some compounds were too intensely fluorescent to be evaluated correctly and were not considered for follow up dose response studies. The NIH small molecule repository was initially screened at 10 uM for DPM-DC inhibitory activity. Three hundred and twenty non-autofluorescent compounds that displayed the highest %inhibition were scored as hits and re-tested at ten concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 100 uM. To confirm that the hits specifically inhibited DPM-DC and not other coupling enzymes used in the assay, the hits were tested in parallel in an assay that contained only these 'coupling enzymes' in the absence of DPM-DC. Diphosphomevalonate Decarboxylase Protocol for 384-well HTS Final Assay concentrations:  25 uL/well 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0 50 mM KCl 4 mM MgCl2 0.4 mM ATP 5uM diphosphomevalonate (DPM) 2 mM Potassium Phosphoenolpyruvate 20 uM NADH 3 units/ml of Rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (Sigma) 3 units/ml of Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (Sigma) 30 nM of DPM-DC 4% DMSO Background conditions are the same as above except that the substrate (DPM) is left out. The assay was run in 384-well black opque plates.  Fifteen ul substrate/background was added to plates using the BeckmanCoulter Biomek FX liquid handling workstation.  Compounds were then added in 1 ul volumes using the FX.  The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 ul of DPM-DC using the Titertek Multidrop peristaltic pipetting platform. The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and the decrease in fluorescence was measured (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) every 16 seconds for 144 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns and 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the MK had been left out (background). The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing DPM-DC with hexokinase.
