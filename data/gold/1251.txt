Arthropod borne viruses (arboviruses) are important human and/or animal pathogens that cause acute virus infections with severe diseases and/or death. Several recent human and/or animal epidemics have been caused by arboviruses, including Dengue virus (DNV) in South America and Asia, West Nile virus (WNV) in North America and Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Europe.  Commercially available vaccines are not available for many arboviruses and those that are available are frequently not 100% efficacious.  For example, there is no commercially available vaccine to protect humans against WNV, which is spreading across the US.  The commercial Dengue vaccine has been under development for decades and still is not effective against all strains of Dengue viruses.  This was recently seen when a new strain of Dengue III spread through South America causing sever disease and death.  So for many arbovirus based diseases, there is no effective vaccine or chemotherapy currently available.  The need to develop antiviral drugs is critical in treating and managing disease.  BTV was selected as a prototype virus from this genus for use in developing a High Throughput Screening protocol.  It was selected because it is not pathogenic in humans, which reduces the risk associated with assay development using infectious agents.  To screen large compound libraries, a CPE based assay was developed in 384-plate format.  The assay measures cytopathic effect (CPE) induced in BSR cells by BTV infection using cell viability as the end point. The screen for inhibitors of CPE caused by BTV infection involves challenging 5000 cells with BTV virus at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of the compounds to be screened. The BTV-10 virus stock was prepared on July 10, 2007 from BSR cells. The assay includes both cell and virus controls and cell survival was measured 72 h post virus addition using CellTiterGlo viability reagent (Promega). Cell viability was determined from intracellular ATP concentration using firefly luciferase as the reporter. Percent cell viability was calculated by using mean luminescence values of the virus-infected cells in the presence of compound divided by the uninfected cell control x 100. Library compounds were screened at 10 uM. Cell Culture: BSR cells were cultured in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, and 5% FBS. The cells are maintained at 37OC, 5.0% CO2 to 90% confluence. Prior to cell plating, cells were re-suspended in DMEM with 100ug/L streptomycin, 100 IU Penicillin/L, 4mM L-glut and 1% FBS (Assay Media). BTV virus culture: The BTV-10 virus stock was prepared in BSR cells using a stock available in Dr. Qianjun Li's laboratory. Briefly, BSR cells were grown in four T75 plates to 90% confluence, and 5ml of BTV-10 virus at 105pfu/ml was then added to the culture media. After three days incubation, cells and the supernatant were harvested and the cells were pelleted.  The cell pellet was re-suspended in 20 ml media, and sonicated. The cell debris was then spun down at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was aliquoted (1ml per tube) and stored at -80 OC. These virus stocks were titrated in BSR cells using the TCID50 method. The titer was 1 X 108 TCID50/ml. Control and Drug Preparation: Carrier Control consisted of DMSO diluted in assay media to 0.6% and 5ul was dispensed to both cell and virus control wells of 384 well black clear-bottom tissue culture treated plates.  Test compounds were diluted in media to 60uM with a DMSO concentration of 0.6%.  5ul was also dispensed to the assay plate.   Cell Plating: Once controls and compounds had been dispensed to the assay plates, 5000 cells/well were plated in 15uL using a Matrix WellMate. Plates were then transferred to the Virology HTS lab and incubated 2-4 hrs at 37oC, 5.0% CO2 and high humidity. Virus Addition: BTV was diluted in media to 5,000 pfu/ml and 10ul was added to the compound wells and the virus control wells (viral MOI of 0.01).  Media only (mock virus) was added to the cell control wells.  All additions were done using a Matrix WellMate housed in a class II Biosafety Cabinet within the BSL-2 laboratory. The plates were incubated for 72 h within the BSL-2 laboratory. Endpoint Read: The assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes and then an equal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega Inc.) was added to each well.  Plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and luminescence was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision multi-label reader with an integration time of 0.1 s. This step was also performed within the BSL-2 facility.
