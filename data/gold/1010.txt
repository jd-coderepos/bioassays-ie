This work's aim is to identify chemical compounds that inhibit cell death induced by ER stress using a cell-based survival assay. Using secondary assays, selectivity of these compounds for the ER stress pathway was defined, and the principal signaling events that are inhibited were dissected. Thapsigargin (TG) was used to induce ER stress, resulting in cell death [13]. Salubrinal, a known chemical inhibitor of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) dephosphorylation [14], was used as compound/positive control in this sceen. Final concentration of each reagent is: (a)Compound control-Salubrinal : 100 uM (b)Negative control: DMSO 1% with thapsigargin treatment (c)Positive control: DMSO 1%, without thapsigargin treatment (d)DMSO concentration during whole procedure : approximately 1% (e)Thapsigargin : 15 uM (f)Library compound : 15 ug/ml (g)ATPlite solution : 40% of final culture volume (20uL/50uL) 1)Undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells were maintained in complete media at 32oC. * Tissue culture complete media: DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 I.U. Penicillin/ml, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Amphotericin 2)CSM14.1 cells were recovered from cultures by trypsinization, and suspended at a density of 7.5 x 104 cells/mL in DMEM medium containing 2% FBS, and same concentration of antibiotics in step 1. 3)Seeding 40 uL per well of the cell suspension to each well of 96 well plastic microtiter plates by 'Well Mate' liquid dispenser , and overnight culture at 32oC.   4)Library compounds were thawed at room temperature for 1 hour, and centrifuged to pellet liquid. Using a BIOMEKTM FX liquid handler (Beckman Coulter), 5 uL of test compounds in 10% DMSO were added to wells in columns 2-11 of the 96 well plates (leaving columns 1 and 12 intact) to achieve an approximate final concentration of 15 ug/mL of test compound and a final concentration of 1.1% DMSO at this point. 5)With step 4), 5 uL of 1 mM Salubrinal solution was added to wells of column 1/rows A-D of each plate, while 5 uL of DMSO solution was added to wells corresponding to column 1/rows E-H and to all wells in column 12. Multi channel pipettor was used to dispense 5uL solutions in column 1, and 12 * Salubrinal solution (1 mM) : 10% DMSO solution of 10mM Salubrinal + 90% DMEM. * DMSO solution (10%):  10% DMSO + 90% DMEM 6)The plates were returned to the incubator for 2 hours.  7)A WellMate bulk reagent dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to dispense 5 uL per well of thapsigargin solution in, thus achieving a final concentration of ~15 uM TG, to columns 1-11, leaving column 12 as a control for data comparison (only DMSO/no TG). Instead, column 12 received 5 uL of DMEM (2% FBS, and same antibiotics concentration) containing 0.0375uL of DMSO by multi channel pipettor. * thapsigargin solution (150uM): 5uL uM thapsigargin solution is composed of 0.0375 ul of 20 mM TG plus 4.9625 ul of complete culture media with 2% FBS. 8)The plates were returned to the incubator for 24 hrs. 9)30 minutes before performing the surrogate cell viability assay in which cellular ATP levels are measured, the components of the ATPliteTM (Perkin-Elmer) kit were prepared.. 10)20 uL of ATPlite solution was dispensed per well using a WellMate. 11)Within 30 minutes, ATP luminescence was evaluated using an Analyst HT multimode plate reader (Molecular Device Corporation) in the luminescence mode. 12)Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc). * For liquid dispensing in step 3), 7) and 10), small nozzle tubing (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was used. Before use, tubing was sterilized by 70% ethanol, and washed intensively by sterilized DW.
