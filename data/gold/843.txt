Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) influences heart rate [1,2], coronary artery caliber, endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity [3] and lymphocyte recirculation [2,4] through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors [5]. Subtype-selective modulators of S1P receptors will be of broad utility in understanding cell functions in vitro and vascular physiology in vivo, as well as de-convoluting the role of individual subtypes in cellular processes.  The S1P receptor 2 (S1P2), also known as endothelial differentiation sphingolipid G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (EDG5), signals through Gi, Gq and G12/13 pathways [6] and has been shown to inhibit cell migration in several cell types [7]. Additionally, many different malignant cells have been shown to overexpress S1P2. For example, S1P2 is expressed in melanoma cells [8] and is co-expressed together with S1P3 in breast cancer cells [9]. Moreover, S1P2 expression has also been found in glioma cells [10] and nine gastric cancer cell lines were shown to express S1P2 to varying degrees [11]. Taken together, these observations implicate S1P2 as a potential player in oncogenesis.  As no selective S1P2 agonist exists, the discovery of selective SIP2 agonists by high-throughput screening will be beneficial for uncovering the physiological and pathological roles of this S1P receptor subtype. A cell line expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter was used to measure activation of the CRE pathway. Under normal conditions, the cells have low CRE basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels.  Stimulation of the CRE pathway by an agonist induces transcription of the BLA gene in proportion to agonist concentration, resulting in increased BLA activity. This increase is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. Protocol Summary: This assay is a counterscreen for nonspecific activators of the cyclic AMP signaling pathway.  Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct were cultured at 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum,  0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Prior to assay 10 ul (100,000 cells/well) of cell suspension were dispensed to each well of 384-well assay plates and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2. The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound from the MLSCN library or DMSO control to the sample or control wells, respectively.   Next, 1.1 ul of forskolin were dispensed to positive control wells (final nominal concentration 2 uM).  Then, 1.1 ul of PBS was dispensed into negative control wells and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours.  After the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid) was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. Percent activation of a test compound well was determined using the following expression: Percent Activation = 100 * [(test compound well ratio - median ratio of negative control wells) / (median ratio of positive control wells - median ratio of negative control wells)] Where: Well ratio is defined as I460nm/I590nm for each well, where I is defined as the measured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength. Negative control wells are defined as wells containing DMSO Positive control wells are defined as wells containing 2 uM forskolin For each compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (42 uM) did not result in greater than 50 percent activation or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 value was determined manually depending on the observed activation at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values greater than 10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 values less than 10 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent activation is observed. This calculation results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.
