The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Wee1 degradation" (PubChem AID 1321), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Wee1 degradation" (PubChem AID 1410), were non-selective inhibitors of protein degradation, as measured by inhibition of cyclin B degradation. The assay uses HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid that encodes a cyclin B-luciferase fusion protein to monitor cyclin B levels.  The cyclin B-luciferase complex is rapidly turned over in these cells. As designed, compounds that inhibit cyclin B degradation will increase cyclin B-luciferase stability, leading to increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. HeLa cells were routinely grown in T75 tissue culture flasks in growth media composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% pen-strep-neo antibiotic mixture at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Cells were transiently transfected in flasks by mixing 6 million cells with 29 micrograms of the Cyclin B-luciferase plasmid complexed with 87 ul of TransIT-LT1 reagent in a final volume of 24 mL of a 1:1 mix of OptiMEM and 2X supplemented DMEM, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 48 hours. Next, the transfected cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 15 to 20 million cells per mL in freezing media (growth media containing 10% DMSO), aliquoted into cryovials, and stored at -80 degrees C until needed. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were thawed, centrifuged and resuspended in growth media at a concentration of 800,000 cells per mL. Next, 5 microliters of cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates (4,000 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, the assay was started by dispensing 25 nL of test compounds in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration), or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (30 micromolar final nominal concentration, set as 100% activation) to the appropriate wells. The plates were next incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was then stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
