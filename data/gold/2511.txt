Cell-based assay for inhibition of SFLLRN-induced P-selectin surface expression.  Washed platelets obtained from individual donors were treated with a selection of compounds resourced as powders found to be active in secondary assays.  Platelet samples were tested at 10uM, 3uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM concentrations. Following compound addition, platelets were subsequently stimulated with 5 mM SFLLRN.  After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (BD Biosciences) was added for a 20-minute incubation.  The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. Geometric mean values were collected for each sample. Expected Outcome: This assay serves as a gate for the defined probe paths.  A moderate decrease in the amount of P-selectin expressed on the surface of platelets in a dose-dependent manner will identify compounds that inhibit pathways that regulate granule secretion or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) expressed on the surface of platelets.    Lack of substantial inhibition of surface expression of P-selectin is indicative of compounds that might selectively effect dense granule secretion. Additional secondary testing will further delineate the specificity of the probes. 1. Platelet samples (10 ul) were tested at different concentrations of compound (100uM, 30uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM for cherry-picks and 30uM, 10uM, 1uM, 0.3uM, and 0uM for powders). 2. 20 minutes following compound addition, platelets were stimulated with 5 uM thrombin-receptor-derived hexapeptide SFLLRN from 100 uM stock. 3. After a 15-minute incubation, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody (5 ul; BD Biosciences) was added. The samples were agitated gently. 4. After a 20-minute incubation, 500 ul of FACS buffer (BD Biosciences) was added to each of the samples. 5. Samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine P-selectin expression on the surface of the platelets as a response to activation. 6. Geometric mean fluorescence values were collected for each sample.
