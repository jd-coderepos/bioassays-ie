Assay Rationale and Summary: The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio vaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are unclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these Polyomaviruses. The oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor antigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that TAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that mutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular transformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate the unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous ATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions has been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of TAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in infected cells. Chemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the catastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus inhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays for target validation will allow a prioritization of "hits" from the primary screen. A biochemical fluorescence-intensity assay in 1536-well microplate format was developed to measure TAg ATPase activity in the presence of potentially inhibitory compounds. Z values are ~0.68, with > 3-fold S/B and a high (5%) DMSO tolerance. The assay was conducted in 1536-well black, clear-bottom microplates. Assay buffer was 100mM Tris-HCl, 20mM KCl, 6mM MgCl2, and 0.1mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4. Initially, 250nl of test compound (20uM final concentration) in 4% DMSO/assay buffer was added to the respective plate wells. Total reaction volume (without endpoint reagent) was 1.25ul. Total read volume (with endpoint reagent) was 5 ul. Enzyme and buffer volumeswere dispensed using a BioRAPTR FRD (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Compounds were dispensed using an Echo 500 Series Liquid Handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA). Purified TAg was diluted to a concentration of 0.0144 ug/ul in assay buffer. 750nl of TAg (14.4ng/ul, 10.8ng total) in assay buffer was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 30m at ambient temperature. Following incubation, 250nl of 5mM ATP (A7699, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in assay buffer was added to the respective wells, and incubated for 120m at ambient temperature. Final DMSO concentration was 1.0%. Endpoint addition and read: After incubation, the ADPHunter-Plus Kit (DiscoverX, Freemont, CA) was used to determine the extent of TAg-induced ATP hydrolysis. 1.25ul of Reagent A, immediately followed by 2.5ul of Reagent B, was added to the wells, and allowed to incubate for a further 10m at ambient temperature. Addition of the kit stop solution had no effect on the assay and subsequently was not used. The plates were bottom-read for fluorescence intensity using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and excitation/emission at 530/590nm respectively. This counter screening assay was performed to determine whether selected active compounds from the primary screen interfered with screening reagents or detection methods in the absence of TAg. In this case the addition of 50 uM ADP simulated assay signal. Compounds were added in dose response format. The assay interference counter screen was read 10 minutes following the addition of the endpoint reagent. Controls and Drug Addition: Controls included full reaction wells (TAg, DMSO blank, and ATP), background wells (Assay buffer, DMSO blank, and ATP), and control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B in DMSO and ATP), per plate. Positive control drug (Mal112B) was diluted in 4% DMSO/assay media and added to each plate (250nl at 5x concentration), for a final concentration of 100uM. 2.5nl of compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed into the 1536-well plates using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), for a final concentration of 20uM. DMSO concentration from the compounds amounted to 0.2%, bringing the total per well to 1%. DMSO in control wells was also supplemented, to maintain a concentration of 1% for all wells of each plate. Large T Antigen purification: TAg was purified essentially as described by Cantalupo, P., et. al.,1999. Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with a TAg-encoding baculovirus. At 45 hpi, cells were harvested and lysed in LiCl and NP40-containing lysis buffer. The lysate was spun at 27000g and the high speed supernatant was loaded to a Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column to which the resin had been covalently crosslinked to the monoclonal antibody PAb419 (Harlow, E. et. al., 1981). PAb419 has been previously described to recognize an N-terminal epitope of TAg. The column was washed, and then eluted at high pH. TAg containing fractions were dialyzed into 10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1mM DTT, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC. Data Analysis: 96 full reaction wells, 96 background wells, and 64 control drug wells (TAg, MAL211B in DMSO and ATP), per plate and used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. The overall Z score for the primary assay was 0.6. Results were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) and calculated as: 100*((Median Enzyme Control-High Dose Ctrl Drug) - (Test well-High Dose Ctrl Drug))/(Median Enzyme Ctrl-High Dose Ctrl Drug). Dose response results for each concentration were analyzed using the IDBS Activity Base software. Compounds showing at least 30% inhibition were considered active and IC50 values were calculated using a four parameter logistic fit to the data (XLFit equation 205) with the maximum and minimum locked at 100 and 0.
