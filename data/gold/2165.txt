Regulation of the differentiation and activity of inflammatory cells through cytokine signaling is essential for proper immune function and to prevent auto-immune disease and leukemias (1, 2). The protein tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is critical for this process (3-6). Following activation of cytokine receptors, particularly erythropoietin and interferon receptors, JAK2 phosphorylates transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family, leading to expression of target genes involved in immune cell homeostasis (2, 3). The discovery of acquired genetic mutations in the JAK2 gene in hematopoetic cells from patients with Myeloid Proliferative Disorders (MPDs) characterized by excess proliferation of differentiated bone marrow myeloid cells (7-10), provided insights into the role of JAK2 in hematopoiesis. The identified JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F) replaces guanine with thymine, resulting in a valine to phenylalanine amino acid substitution at codon 617 within the pseudokinase JH2 autoinhibitory domain (7-10). The resulting JAK2V617F variant is constitutively active, mediating JAK-STAT signaling efficiently even in the absence of ligand. Thus, the discovery of small molecules that can differentially inhibit JAK2V617F and not wildtype JAK2 may provide insights into JAK2 signaling in hematopoiesis and MPD pathogenesis (11, 12). Following the screening campaign (AIDs 1446, 1486, 1520, 1521, 1691, and 1699), certain compounds were identified as possible candidates for probe development. Compounds of interest were reordered as powders, and analogs were purchased or synthesized and tested in assays to determine potency (Assay 1), cytotoxicity (Assay 2), and selectivity (Assays 3-4). The probe development effort based on the hits from the HTS screening campaign resulted in no improvement over the prior art. No probes were identified and the SRIMSC probe development effort for this project has now stopped. Details of protocols, compound structures, and results from the original assays can be found in PubChem at the respective AIDs listed below. JAK2V617F Inhibition Assay (Assay 1): The purpose of these assays is to determine whether purchased or synthesized analogs of the original HTS hits act as inhibitors of the mutant JAK2V617 kinase. This assay employs the same protocol as AID 1691. This assay employs a murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 that stably co-expresses EpoR and JAK2V617F, resulting in cytokine independent growth. As a result, JAK2V617F inhibition is cytotoxic. In the assay, cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit JAK2V617F activity will reduce cell viability and therefore ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. Compounds were tested in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a maximum nominal concentration of 40 micromolar. Ba/F3 Cell Line Cytotoxicity Counterscreen Assay (Assay 2): The purpose of these assays is to determine whether compounds of interest were nonselective inhibitors due to cytotoxicity of the parental Ba/F3 cell line. This assay employs the same protocol as AID 1699. In this assay, murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell viability is measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent, which contains luciferase to catalyze the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. As designed, compounds that inhibit cell viability will lead to decreased ATP levels, resulting in decreased luciferase activity and well luminescence. Compounds were tested in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a maximum nominal concentration of 40 micromolar. irf1 Inhibition Assay (Assay 3): The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit endogenous JAK2V617F activity. This assay employs CellSensor irf1-bla human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells which stably express a beta-lactamase reporter gene under control of the STAT5 response element from the interferon regulatory factor-1 (irf1) gene promoter (Invitrogen). HEL cells are growth factor independent and contain an endogenous homozygous JAK2V617F mutation which leads to constitutive STAT5 activity. Due to the constitutive STAT5 activity in these cells, irf1-bla HEL cells constitutively express beta-lactamase. In this assay, cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by addition of the LiveBLAzer FRET B/G substrate and measurement of the ratio of fluorescence at 447 nM and 520 nM. As designed, compounds that inhibit endogenous JAK2V617 activity will reduce irf1 promoter activity, leading to reduced beta-lactamase production and substrate cleavage, thereby decreasing the 447/520 ratio. The dose response assay was run in triplicate in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a nominal concentration of 40 micromolar. irf1 Inhibition Counterscreen Assay (Assay 4): The purpose of this assay is to identify nonselective active compounds from the previous screen. This assay employs CellSensor irf1-bla mouse pro B (Ba/F3) cells which stably express a beta-lactamase reporter gene under control of the STAT5 Response Element present in the interferon regulatory factor-1 (irf1) gene promoter (Invitrogen). Ba/F3 cells are growth dependent on IL-3 and have an intact IL-3#JAK2#STAT5 pathway. In this assay, cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by addition of the LiveBLAzer FRET B/G substrate and measurement of the ratio of fluorescence at 447 nM and 520 nM. As designed, compounds that inhibit the IL-3#JAK2#STAT5 pathway will lead to reduced beta-lactamase production and substrate cleavage, thereby decreasing the 447/520 ratio. The dose response assay was run in triplicate in a 10-point dose-response series starting at a nominal concentration of 40 micromolar.
