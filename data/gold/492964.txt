Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 485270). This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that stably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX1R/Hcrtr1 (CHO-OX1R). This receptor signals through phospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of receptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX1R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX1R activation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R/Hcrtr1 antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in triplicate at a nominal concentration of 6.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 350 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO and antagonist controls in DMSO were added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC80 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I618nm Where: I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm. I618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A. The average percent inhibition and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Any compound that exhibited an average percent inhibition greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the primary orexin 1 IP-One screen (AID 485270) was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-46, and for inactive compounds 46-0.
