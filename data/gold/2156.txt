Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for identification of compounds that inhibit KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) potassium channels. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit KCNQ2 potassium channels. This assay employs a CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the KCNQ2 potassium channel. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. As designed, compound effects on the KCNQ2 channel were measured by thallium assay, using a commercial kit, the FluxOR detection kit. Those CHO-K1 cells stably expressing KCNQ2 channels were plated into 384-well plates.  On the following day, cells were loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR, and then incubated with assay buffer, followed by the addition of compounds.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and detected upon the addition of stimulus solution (2.5 mM K2SO4 and 2.5 mM Tl2SO4).The fluorescence of FluxOR was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound has a B-score of less than minus 3*SD of the average B score of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as a inhibitor of the KCNQ2 channel. Protocol for the KCNQ2 project: 1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 500 ug/ml G418. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 120,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS. 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 25 ul /well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells. 5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in darkness. 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on the Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer (IC0), ICmax of XE-991  (all with DMSO concentrations matched to that of test compounds). 7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system. 9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in darkness. 10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 12.5 mM K2SO4 and 12.5 mM Tl2SO4. 11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. 12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline. 13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds. 14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0. 15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [13]. 16. Calculate B scores [14] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14. 17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more negative than -3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (<=-3*SD), AND the B score of initial fluorescence intensity is within 2 times the standard deviation of the B scores of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as an active (Value=2) inhibitor of the KCNQ2 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1). 18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 0 and 100 by calculation of INT(100*LOG(B Score inhibitor Ratio)), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B Score inhibitor Ratio), B Score inhibitor Ratio, as in the result definition.
