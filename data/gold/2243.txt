The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein controls cell cycle progression by regulating the activity of the transcription factor E2F (1), which activates genes essential for DNA replication. Due to the critical role of RB in regulating the cell cycle, factors that bind and regulate RB activity are considered valuable targets for preventing tumorigenesis. One such protein, RB binding protein 9 (RBBP9), is widely expressed in different tissues and upregulated in certain tumors (2, 3). The RBBP9 protein contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, which belongs to the DUF1234 domain superfamily of unknown function. Although an enzymatic activity of RBBP9 has not been reported, this protein does react with activity-based probes that target serine hydrolases, suggesting that it is a functional enzyme. Also consistent with this premise, the crystal structure of RBBP9 was recently solved and revealed a well-structured active site with a properly arranged catalytic triad (4). A role for RBBP9 in cellular transformation is supported by studies showing that RBBP9 mRNA expression is increased in transformed rat liver cell lines and human liver tumor biopsies (3). Furthermore, RBBP9-overexpressing cells form tumors when implanted into immuno-deficient mice (3), and RBBP9 overexpression confers resistance to TGF-&#946;1-induced growth inhibition through its interaction with Rb and displacement of E2F (3, 5). RBBP9 is also suggested to play a role in gender-related differential responses to radiation-induced cell proliferation (6). As a result, the identification of compounds that selectively inhibit RBBP9 activity may provide valuable probes for the study of apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis. This cytotoxicity counterscreen was performed as part of a probe development effort to identify inhibitor probes of RBBP9 belonging to the oxime ester scaffold.

Assay Overview: Please see AIDs 1515 and 1537, Summary AID 1790, and below for all protocols performed in this probe development effort. The purpose of this assay is to determine cytotoxicity of inhibitor compounds belonging to the oxime ester scaffold. In this assay, HEK cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 40 micromolar. Protocol Summary: This assay was started by dispensing 5 x 10E3 HEK 293T cells/well into a 96-well plate. Compound (0.001-100 mM) or DMSO was added to each well, and after 48h cell viability was determined by the CellTitre assay (Promega).
