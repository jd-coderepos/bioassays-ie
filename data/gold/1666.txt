Mineralization of cartilage and bone occurs by a series of physicochemical and biochemical processes that together facilitate the deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) in specific areas of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Experimental evidence has pointed to the presence of HA crystals along collagen fibrils in the ECM and also within the lumen of chondroblast- and osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs). Dr.  Milan's  working model is that bone mineralization is first initiated within the lumen of MVs. In a second step, HA crystals grow beyond the confines of the MVs and become exposed to the extracellular milieu where they continue to propagate along collagen fibrils. Recent data have indicated that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) plays a crucial role in restricting the concentration of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PP), a mineralization inhibitor, to maintain a P/PPi ratio permissive for normal bone mineralization. Using a variety of single and double gene knockout experiments it has been found that mice deficient in TNAP function, i.e., Akp2-/- mice, display osteomalacia due to an arrest in the propagation of HA crystals outside the MVs caused by an increase in extracellular PPi concentrations. Inside the MVs, however, HA crystals are still present in Akp2-/- mice. It is hypothesize that a newly identified soluble phosphatase, PHOSPHO1, with specificity for phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and phosphoserine (PS) present in the MVs, is responsible for increasing the local concentration of Pi inside the MVs to change the P/PPi ratio to favor precipitation of HA seed crystals. This biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the enzyme's ability to liberate phosphate from phosphoethanolamine and its reaction with Biomol Green reagent. This dose response assay is developed and performed to confirm hits originally identified in "uHTS absorbance assay for the identification of compounds that inhibit PHOSPHO1" (AID 1565) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. 1) POSPHO1 was obtained from the assay provider's laboratory. 2) Assay Buffer: 20mM MES-NaOH pH 6.7, 2mM MgCl2, 0.0125% Tween-20, 0.01% BSA Procedure 1) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration.   2 uL of compounds in 10% DMSO were transferred into columns 3-22 of Greiner 384-well white small-volume plates (784075). Each curve was performed in duplicate. 2) Columns 1-2 and 23-24 contained 4 uL of NC and PC solutions, respectively. For the following additions, using the Multidrop sterilizing the tubing with copious amounts of water and 70% EtOH before and after each reagent. 3) Add 9 uL of buffer to columns 1-2. 4) Add 9 uL PHOSPHO1 intermediate solution to columns 3-24. 5) Add 9 uL of PEA intermediate solution to the entire plate (columns 1-24). 6) Spin plate down to maintain an even level of volume. 7) Incubate plate at room temperature for 1 hr (covered). 8) Add 20 uL of Biomol Green to the entire plate (columns 1-24). 9) Spin plate down to maintain an even level of volume. 10) Incubate plate for 30 mins to allow Biomol signal to develop. 11) Read plate on a Perkin Elmer Viewlux at 630nm in absorbance mode
