Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human herpes virus 4 (HHV-4), is a member of the larger herpesvirus family that consists of three subfamilies. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an extremely prevalent human herpesvirus. Disease syndromes in humans caused by EBV reflect the cell types that EBV infects, which are primarily of lymphoid or epithelial origin. Infection of both cell types is associated with a variety of proliferative disorders and cancers. Current treatments for such malignancies are traditional chemotherapy, radiation-therapy, surgery, and if possible, restoration of immune system function. Like all herpesviruses, EBV has mechanisms to evade the immune system and maintain latency in the human host. A treatment directed specifically against EBV could significantly improve patient care by limiting initial acute infection and spread of the virus between cells. Currently there are no inhibitors that block the entry of EBV. EBV gH and gL proteins form a heterodimeric complex and are required for membrane fusion with all known EBV-targeted cell types. gp42 is an EBV-encoded protein and is essential for EBV infection of B cells. In EBV, gH/gL forms a high affinity complex with gp42 prior to MHC class II binding and the activation of membrane fusion. In B cell fusion, gp42 binding to gH/gL is required for fusion activation. The central role of the EBV gH/gL protein in viral entry into both B cells and epithelial cells makes it an attractive target for the development of anti-viral inhibitors. To discover novel small molecule inhibitors of EBV induced membrane fusion and entry, which act by blocking essential viral protein interactions, a highly sensitive fluorescence polarization (FP) based assay was designed and optimized. In this assay, the interaction between the gH/gL protein with a fluorescently labeled peptide derived from gp42 was used as a model system.  A simple 1-step mix-and-measure method was achieved for analyzing gH/gL protein and gp42 interaction. gH/gL protein FP assay is highly stable and has achieved a robust performance in a 1536-well uHTS format with a demonstrated signal-to-noise ratio of above 10 and a Z### factor of above 0.7. Because of its simplicity and high sensitivity, this assay is used for ultra high-throughput screening in 1536 well format of small molecules that bind directly to EBV gH/gL and block EBV entry. Positives from the primary screen, AID 1085, were selected for testing in this confirmatory assay. 1.Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2.gH/gL protein 3.gp42-36-81 peptide with an N-terminal fluorescein label (gp42-Flu) Procedure: 1.   Make assay reaction buffer for uHTS that contains gH/gL protein (2 nM, final concentration), gp42-Flu peptide (2 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 4.5 uL of assay reaction buffer to 1536-well black assay plate. 3. Add appropriate amount of compound to each well to reach assay concentration and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. 4. Record FP signals with an Envision Multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences. Data analysis: 1.FP signals are expressed as mP and recorded by Envision Multilabel plate reader. 2.Assay data are analyzed using CambridgeSoft.  Percentage of inhibition is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Inhibition = 100 - ((FPcompound - FPpeptide only) / (FPcontrol -FPpeptide only)) * 100 Where FPcompound is the FP value from a well with a test compound, FPpeptide only is an average FP value from wells with gp42-Flu peptide only; FP value control is an average FP values from wells containing gH/gL protein and gp42-Flu peptide, which defines maximal FP signal. A 4 parameter logistic equation is fit to each compound using software from the R project for statistical analysis: Y = ((Top-Bottom)/(1+(conc/X50)^Curvature))+Bottom All of the fitted parameters are reported, as well as the relative IC50 (the point halfway between the fitted top and bottom of the curve), and the absolute IC50 (the point at which the dose response curve passes 50% activity). Compounds with an Absolute IC50 of <30 uM are given a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of Active. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is calculated by normalizing the observed range of absolute IC50s between 100 and 0, with the lowest IC50 corresponding to 100.
