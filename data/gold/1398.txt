The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (AID 1267). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 871 and AID 1267; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation"(AID 932); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB activation" (AID 1309); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT3 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT1 activation" (AID 1318). In this assay STAT3 activation was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring well luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 activator will increase IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus increasing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 uM. The activator and inhibitor dose response assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 ug/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Then, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/mL final nominal EC80 concentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed into all wells. The plates were then incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
