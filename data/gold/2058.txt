Addictive behavior stems from abnormal signaling activities in the brain. Thus identification of compounds blocking this modified signaling activity may lead to treatments for addictive behavior. GPR35, a to-date uncharacterized orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, is thought to play a role in addiction and has homology to other known receptors of abuse.  The goal of this project is to identify small molecule antagonists of GPR35, which may aid in characterization of this receptor and ultimately further the understanding of the role of GPR35 in addictive behavior. This high content imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the GPR35 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to clathrin-coated pits, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins.  When this receptor is blocked by an antagonist, this arrestin-GFP redistribution is inhibited and can be detected as a decrease in local concentrations of fluorescent arrestins as compared to the agonist activity.  Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR35 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-Strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 10mM Hepes, and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Positive Control Working Solution: 2.0% DMSO diluted in PBS 5) Agonist Working Solution: Zaprinast (Alexis # ALX-430-020-M010 - 10mg, 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted in PBS to 100uM 6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Primary Screen Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (133,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates were incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3)   Serum was removed by media aspiration and replaced with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds.  4) Compound addition was done on a Biomek FX with 384-head dispenser (Beckman): a) 5ul of 100uM compound solution was added to columns 3 through 24 of the assay plates for a final assay compound concentration of 10uM and 0.5% DMSO.  b) 5ul of 5% DMSO was added to columns 1 and 2 to balance the volume and DMSO concentration across the plate. c) 5ul of positive control (2% DMSO) working solution was added to column 1. 5) Plates were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. 6) Agonist addition was done on a Biomek FX with 384-head dispenser (Beckman): a) 5ul of agonist (100uM Zaprinast) working solution was added to columns 2-24.  (This also serves as the negative control in column 2.) 7) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2.  8) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  9) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 10) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 11) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 12) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate seals were applied to each plate. Hit Confirmation Procedure: A. Single-Concentration Confirmation 1) Same as primary screen, except compound addition was done using the ECHO550 Acoustic Dispenser using 2mM compound stock solution, volumes were adjusted accordingly and the final DMSO concentration was 0.31%. B. Dose Response Confirmation 1) Same as primary screen steps 1 and 2. 2) Volume after media aspiration and replace (step 3) was 50ul. 3) Compound addition was done on the ECHO555 Acoustic Dispenser. The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 32uM to 500nM (seven doses), performed in duplicate and on 2 different days. b. For control wells, 177.6nL of 100% DMSO was added to columns 1 and 2 for a final DMSO concentration of 0.32%. 4) Plates were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. 5) 5.5ul of agonist (100uM Zaprinast) working solution was added to columns 2-24 using the Biomek FX with 384-head dispenser (Beckman).  (This also serves as the negative control in column 2.) 6) 5.5ul of 2% DMSO was manually added to column 1. 7) Primary screen procedure steps 7 to 12 were followed. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: - 40x 0.6 NA air objective - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm  mission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters - 3 fields per well for Primary screen - 4 fields per well for Hit Confirmation 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm with the following analysis settings: NUCLEI DETECTION - Threshold Adjustment:     4 - Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   10 - Individual Threshold Adjustment   0.05 - Minimum Nuclear Area:    200 - Minimum Nuclear Contrast:   0 CYTOPLASM DETECTION - Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0 SPOT DETECTION - Spot Minimum Distance    3 - Spot Peak Radius     0 - Spot Reference Radius    3 - Spot Minimum Contrast    0.26 - Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   0.5 3) Metrics calculated from... NUCLEI IMAGES: Cell Count ("NumberofCellsAnalyzed"), Nuclei Area ("AreaoftheNucleus"), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei ("TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus"), Average Intensity of the Nuclei ("AverageIntensityoftheNucleus") GFP IMAGES: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity"), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots ("TotalSpotIntensity"), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities ("RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity"), Number of Spots per Cell ("AverageSpotsPerCell")
