The PKD HTS assay was developed and run at the University of Pittsburgh Molecular Screening Center (PMLSC) as part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN)(1R03DA24898-01). Protein kinase D (PKD) is a novel family of serine/threonine kinases targeted by diacylglycerol. It regulates many fundamental cell functions including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and protein trafficking, and plays important roles in pathological conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy and cancer in multiple organ systems. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of PKD are not clearly understood, and the role of PKD in cancer and other diseases has not been fully defined. This is partly due to the lack of effective pharmacological tools that specifically target PKD in normal cellular processes and in pathological conditions. The immediate goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an IMAP-based fluorescent polarization (FP) assay for high throughput screening (HTS) of PKD inhibitors. The assay we are proposing is in a 384-well, small volume format and has been adapted for high throughput screening. The objective is to discover novel potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of PKD that will be helpful in understanding the biological relevance of PKD and have the potential for long-term therapeutic application. Hits identified from screening the 57K library (second HTS campign) were subjected to an assay binding interference assay.

Compounds (from the 57K library addition- second HTS campaign) were tested for interference with the assay format (in IC50 format)
