DnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa substrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638). It has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of chaperones.  In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good target for the small organic molecules.  Here, we propose to use unbiased NMR-based screening to identify some small molecules that bind to the DnaK substrate binding domain, which will be further developed into potentially chemical tools against DnaK. 1.Protein expression and purification The gene coding for the E. coli Dnak substrate binding domain (393-507) was amplified with PCR and subcloned into pET21a using the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites. The resulting protein contains proteins with 17 extra amino acid residues (mgsshhhhhhglvprgs) at the N-termini. The protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) plys S and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The uniformly 15N-lableled DnaK was produced by growing the bacteria in M9 minimal media containing 15NHCl as the sole nitrogen source. The NMR samples were dissolved in 20 uM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 90%/10% (H2O/D2O) or 99.5% D2O. 3. NMR Based Screening A. Ligand binding was monitored by comparing the aliphatic region of 1D 1H NMR spectra of a 20 uM DnaK (393-507) solution (20 uM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 containing 90%/10% H2O/D2O or 99.5% D2O; T= 300 K) in the presence and in absence of compounds tested at a final concentration of 125 uM. Compounds were initially tested at mixtures of 10, and then individual compounds for those mixtures that caused significant perturbations in the spectrum (>0.08 ppm) were subsequently tested for an estimated Kd with a single titration point (3:1 ligand:protein molar ratio, protein at 30 uM concentration). Compounds with an estimated Kd values of < 500 uM are subsequently measured by a complete NMR titration. B. Hit compounds with estimated Kd values of 200 uM or less are selected for further SAR studies including Kd determination by ITC. Analogues are selected and purchased directly from commercial sources and tested for binding to the target. SAR data are further analyzed to design additional analogues to be chemically synthesized. 4.Binding Constant Determination by NMR Dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) of ligands were determined by monitoring the protein chemical shift changes as a function of ligand concentration. Kd of ligand is initially estimated with a single titration point according to the following equation: Kd=[To](1-p)([Lo]-[To]*p)/([To]*p) To and Lo are total concentration of target protein and ligand, respectively. The parameter p represents the fractional population of bound versus free species at equilibrium, which for fast exchanging ligands is measured as: p = (^obs - ^f)/(^sat - ^free) ^obs is the observed receptor chemical shift during the titration, and ^free and ^sat are the chemical shifts for the receptor in the unbound and fully bound (saturated) states, respectively. Hit compounds (those with the highest estimated binding affinity:in this case those with Kd values of 500 uM or better) are subsequently determined more accurately by a more complete NMR titration. At least six data points were collected for different concentration of ligand and Kd can then be determined by a non-linear least squares fit of p versus [Lo]. p = {([To]+[Lo]+Kd)- Sqr(([To]+[Lo] + Kd)**2 -4[Lo][To])}/2[To]
