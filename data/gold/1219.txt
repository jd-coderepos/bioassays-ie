To assign functional characteristics to compounds identified in our previous binding and dose-response screens, a functional assay to assess estrogen-mediated translocation of PIP3 was employed. This assay uses the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt (Protein kinase B). This PH domain binds specifically to PI(3,4,5)P3 and, when fused to RFP, can be used as a reporter of PIP3 localization in the cell at different points following stimulation. Stimulation of cells co-expressing GPR30 and PH-RFP with estrogen and other GPR30 agonists leads to a translocation of PH-RFP from a diffuse cytosolic localization to a nuclear localization. This translocation can be blocked using an GPR30 antagonist. Cos7 cells (ATCC # CRL-1651) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine. 200,000 cells were seeded into 6- well tissue culture plates and co-transfected with GPR30-GFP and PH-RFP at a ratio of 3:1 using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, per manufacturers instructions). Six hours following transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded onto 12 milliM glass coverslips (7500 cells / coverslip) and allowed to adhere for 18 hours, at which point media was changed and cells were grown in phenol-red free, serum-free DMEM F-12 containing Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine for 24 hours prior to assay. Transfected cells were stimulated with compound, vehicle or estrogen to assess PI3K translocation in response to estrogen-mediated signaling. To screen for agonist activity, compound was applied to cells and incubated at 37 degreesC for 15 minutes. For assessment of antagonist activity, cells were firs incubated with potential antagonist for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, then sitmulated with low-dose estrogen (10 nanoM) for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following stimulation, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at 37 degreesC, washed 3x with PBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. Slides were stored at -20 degreesC prior to visualization. Assessment of translocation of the PI3P reporter, PH-RFP, was visually scored. Compounds which fully translocated PH-RFP to the nucleus (equal to estrogen-mediated translocation) were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds with a moderate level of PH-RFP translocation were assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 50 and compounds which induced no translocation of PH-RFP were assigned a value of 0. Scoring of antagonists was as completed in a similar manner, with compunds that completely blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100, compounds which partially blocked estrogen-mediated translocation of PH-RFP assigned a score of 50, and all inactive compounds assigned a score of 0. The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME was based on the activity scores, with "Active" compunds being those with PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCOREs of 100 and were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 2. "In-active" compounds having a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0-50 and PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of 1.
