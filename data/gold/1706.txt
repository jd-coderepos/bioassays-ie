QFRET-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS coronavirus 3C-like Protease (3CLPro). The purpose of this biochemical assay is to identify compounds that inhibit SARS-3CLpro-mediated peptide cleavage. In this assay, a fluorescent compound, HiLyte fluor TM 488, is attached at the N-terminus of a 3CLpro peptide substrate and is FRET quenched by a QXLTM520 moiety attached at the C-terminus. When the peptide is cleaved by SARS-3CLpro the fluorescent compound and quencher separate, leading to an increase in well fluorescence when measured at an excitation wavelength of 485nm and an emission wavelength of 535nm. As designed, compounds that inhibit 3CLpro activity will prevent cleavage of the labeled peptide substrate, thus leaving the fluorescent tag unquenched on the peptide, resulting in no increase in well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6 uM. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4 ul of 3CLpro enzyme (150 nM final concentration) in assay buffer (50mM HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.01% Triton-X 100, 2 mM DTT) at pH 7.5 was dispensed into each well of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO, 3CLpro inhibitor (300 uM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The assay was started by dispensing 1 ul of 3Clpro peptide substrate (2 uM final concentration) in 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 to each well. After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 1 ul of 500 mM acetic acid was added to each well to terminate the assay and well fluorescence was read on a PerkinElmer Viewlux using fluorescein filters: excitation wavelength of 480 nm (with 20 nm bandwidth) and emission wavelength of 540 nm (with 20 nm bandwidth). The % inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (RFU_Test_Compound - MedianRFU_Low_Control)/(MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing 3CLpro inhibitor. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 15 and active compounds range of activity score is 15 to 100.
