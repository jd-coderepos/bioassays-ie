Fluorescence-based dose response cell-based high-throughput screening assay for agonists of NPY-Y1. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neurotransmitter with physiologic roles including control of feeding behavior, regulation of cortical neural activity, heart neural activity, and emotional regulation. Importantly, NPY is implicated in human diseases such as obesity, depression and alcoholism. NPY mediates its biological effects in part through activation of the Galphai protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) NPY-Y1 and Y2 receptors, which decrease cytosolic cAMP production. Recent studies have implicated these receptors in diverse biological events, including feeding (1), alcoholism (2), anxiety and depression (3), pain perception (4), immunity and inflammation (5), vascular remodeling (6), hypothermia (7), pancreatic islet cell function (8), bone and energy metabolism (9), and tumorigenesis (10). Therefore, the identification and characterization of small molecule modulators of NPY signaling and high affinity selective ligands for NPY receptors may prove useful for understanding NPY-associated human disease. The purpose of this assay is to determine NPY-Y1 potentiation dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1 (AID 1304), "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (AID 1546), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2" (AID 1359), and "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity" (AID 1704). In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as a potentiator or agonist of NPY-Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 35 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 ug/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY (75 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where: T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and; T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = ( MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 75 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-100, for inactive 1-0.
