BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB).  The importance of ubiquitin conjugation in many cellular processes suggests a critical role of DUBs in normal physiology and potentially in pathological conditions.  Small molecule BAP1 inhibitors were identified using a kinetic, high-throughput BAP1 activity assay (AID 436).  In this assay, ubiquitin conjugated to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC) was used as a BAP1 substrate. Hydrolysis of UbAMC by BAP1 results in the release of free AMC and an increase in fluorescence.  The reaction velocity is measured as the increase in fluorescence over time and is proportional to BAP1 activity.  Compounds identified in the initial single-dose screen have been confirmed in dose response using the same assay format.  To date, UbAMC is the only substrate commercially available for in vitro DUB activity assays. However, the excitation/emission wavelengths of AMC (ex. 360 nm, em. 425 nm) overlap with those of many small molecules, which leads to a high percentage of fluorescence artifacts.  To overcome the problem of interference by compound autofluorescence, we replaced UbAMC with ubiquitin-rhodamine(110)-glycine (UbRHO).  The excitiation/emission wavelegths of RHO (ex. 485 nm, em. 520 nm) are right-shifted compared to those of AMC and therefore has less overlap with autofluorescent compounds.  RHO also generates a much stronger fluorescent signal, which greatly increases assay sensitivity, signal-to-background ratio, and allows for the use of less substrate. To test selectivity for BAP1, hit compounds were also tested in parallel against UCH-L1, a closely related DUB in the UCH family.  Selectivity data for selected compounds are also presented in this assay.  Analogs of hits identified in the BAP1 primary screen (AID 436) were tested in this assay.  Each compound was tested at 8-11 concentrations in 1:2 serial dilutions from the highest concentration (50-100 micromolar). Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  Procedure: 1. Dilute BAP1 (provided by assay PI), L1 (Boston Biochem cat# E-340), and UbRHO (provided by assay PI) in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 25-100 mM NaCl, 100 ug/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.4, 5 mM DTT). Keep on ice and protect UbRHO from light. 2. Add 12.5 ul of BAP1 or L1 (5 nM final) to 384-well black plate with appropriate controls. 3. Transfer 0.5 uL compounds to 384-well plate to arrive at final compound concentrations. 4. Add 12.5 ul 50-100 nM UbRHO (50 nM final for BAP1, 25-50 nM final for L1) 5. The fluorescence intensity (FI) was measured immediately with an Analyst HT reader using kinetic settings.  The plate was read every 1 minute 45 seconds for 10 readings using a 505 nm dichroic mirror (ex. 485 nm, em. 520 nm). 6. All compounds were tested in triplicate Data analysis: Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. The velocity was calculated using the slope from a linear fit of the individual readings. Where appropriate, data points recorded at times beyond the linear range of reaction were omitted from velocity determination. The average velocity of the blank wells for the plate was subtracted from each compound velocity. The blank-subtracted values were then normalized to the negative controls to arrive at the average Percentage of Control for each concentration.  BAP1 selectivity is represented as the as the ratio of BAP1 and L1 IC50 values (i.e. the higher the ratio, the more selective for BAP1). For each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using software from the R Project for Statistical Computing. This assay was used to evaluate the relative potency (IC50) and selectivity of active compounds as BAP1 inhibitors.  All compounds were marked as active, and all compounds given an activity score of 100.
