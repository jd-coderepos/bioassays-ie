The intraerythrocytic stages of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum employs two cytosolic neutral aminopeptidases, an M1-family alanyl aminopeptidase (M1AAP) and an M17-family leucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP), in the terminal stages of host hemoglobin digestion. Their action results in the release of free amino acids that are used for the anabolism of parasite proteins and, hence, are critical to the development of the parasite in red blood cells. Inhibitors of the two exopeptidases prevent the growth of P. falciparum parasites in vitro, and protect mice from infection with rodent malaria P. chabaudi, providing strong evidence that these enzymes are targets which can be used to develop new anti-malarial drugs.  Thus, Plasmodium falciparum M17-family leucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP) is an attractive chemotherapeutic target and was used to screen a large (200K) chemical library to identify novel inhibitors as probes for this enzyme in Plasmodium falciparum.  A simple assay using a fluorogenic peptide substrate (H-Leu-NHMec) was used for quantifying the activity of M17LAP. The rate of hydrolysis of this substrate was measured by monitoring the release of the -NHMec fluorogenic leaving group at an excitation wavelength of 370nm and an emission wavelength of 460nm.  A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that fluoresce at these wavelengths. A total of 217,147 compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 30 uM.  For follow-up testing, the 1139 most potent inhibitors were tested in a dose response assay at concentrations ranging from 100-1.0 uM. M17LAP Assay Protocol for 1536-well HT Purified recombinant M17LAP enzyme was provided by Prof. John Dalton, Institute for the Biotechnology of Infectious Diseases (IBID) University of Technology Sydney. Compound Dosing/Plating: For the primary screen 15 nl of compounds in DMSO were dispensed into 1536-well black non-binding surface plates. This resulted in a concentration of 30 uM of compound in the assay.  For the follow up dose response assays 8 concentrations of each compound ranging from 100-1 uM were used. Assay Setup: 2.5 uL of M17LAP reagent mix, which included the fluorogenic peptide substrate (H-Leu-NHMec) in assay buffer, was added to each well of the previously compound dosed 1536-well plates.  The reaction was initiated with the addition of 2.5 uL of the M17LAP diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 0.1 mM H-Leu-NHMec and 100 ug/ml M17LAP diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2% DMSO). The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 370nm and an emission wavelength of 460nm at 35 second intervals for 315 seconds (10 readings). Each plate had 256 control wells in the eight outside columns with 128 wells containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 128 wells in which the M17LAP had been left out (background).
