The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects. The purpose of this assay was to screen for M1 antagonists using the human M1 receptor in a calcium mobilization assay. Assay Info: For measurement of antagonist-inhibited increases in intracellular calcium, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M1 receptors were plated in 96 or 384-well plates overnight at 37degrees C and 5% CO2.  The next day, medium was removed and the cells were loaded with calcium indicator dye (2uM Fluo-4 AM) for 45-60 min at 37 degrees C. Dye was removed and replaced with the appropriate volume of assay buffer, pH 7.4 (1X HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution), supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid). All compounds were diluted in assay buffer for a 60 uM 2X stock concentration (30 uM final concentration) in 0.6% DMSO. This stock was then added to the assay plate for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3%. Acetylcholine EC20 and EC80 stocks were prepared at a 10x stock solution in assay buffer prior to addition to the assay plates. Calcium mobilization was measured at 25 degrees C using a Functional Drug Screening System (FDSS 7000; Hamamatsu) or a FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the following protocol. Cells were preincubated with test compound (or vehicle) for 1.5 min prior to the addition of the EC20 of acetylcholine followed 1 min later by the addition of an EC80 of acetylcholine. The signal amplitude was first normalized to baseline and then as a percentage of the EC80 response. Compounds designated as 'Active' reduced the EC80 acetylcholine response to less than or equal to 15% of the vehicle control sample, and thus were given a 'Score' of '100'. 'Inactive' compounds gave greater than 15% of the EC80 response when compared to the vehicle controls.
