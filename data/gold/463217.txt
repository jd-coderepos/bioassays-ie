The aim of this assay was to characterize downstream ERK phosphorylation activity of compounds originally identified in "Image-based HTS for Selective Antagonists of GPR35" (AID 2058). Componds were either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized by the Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics. This In-Cell Western assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and human GPR35 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurs as measured by pERK1/2 antibodies. Assay Materials: 1) 96-well plates (FALCON 353075) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and human GPR35 receptor 3) Culture Media: DMEM with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 100ug/ml Zeocin 4) EC80 concentration of Agonist: 10 uM Zaprinast 5) DMSO solution 6) Test compounds Working Solution: 10mM  Stock in 100% DMSO, diluted in assay buffer (HBSS Cellgro #21-023-CV) 7) Fixative Solution: 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS 8) Permeabilization Solution: 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS 9) Primary phosphor-ERK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, diluted 1:100) 10) Goat anti-rabbit 800CW secondary antibody diluted 1:800 in Licor blocking buffer together with Sapphire700 (diluted 1:1000) and DRAQ5 (diluted 1:2000) for normalization purpose Assay Procedure: 1) Cells were grown to confluence in 96-well plates and serum-starved overnight prior to assay.  2) Prior to drug treatment cells were washed once with HBSS at room temperature. 3) Compounds were added at varying dose response concentrations together with the agonist (10uM Zaprinast) to compound and negative control wells. 4) DMSO was added to all wells to achieve a final concentration of 0.1%. 5) Plates were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature.  6) Media was aspirated from all wells.  7) Fixative solution was added to each well for a final concentration of 4% PFA and plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. 8) Fixative was aspirated and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Trion X-100 in PBS for 5 washes at 10 minutes per wash. 9) LI-COR blocking buffer was added and samples were shaken on a rotator for 1 hour. 10) Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 degree C with rotation, followed by washing 4 times for 5 minutes each in PBS+ 0.1% Tween-20 with gentle shaking at room temperature. 11) Cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. Sapphire700 and DRAQ5 solutions were added together with the secondary antibodies for normalization. Plates were protected from light. 12) Plates were washed 4 times for 5 minutes each in PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 with gentle shaking at room temperature, and were protected from light. 13) Plates were dried and scanned using a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager. 14) IC50 values were calculated employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression in Prism 4.0 software.
