Dose response counterscreen for agonists of galanin receptor 2 (GalR2): a cell-based high-throughput screening assay for activators of beta-lactamase activity The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Confirmatory cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of galanin receptor 2 (GALR2)" (PubChem AID 864).  Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of approximately 56 micromolar.  This assay also serves to determine whether these compounds were assay artifact due to non-specific activation of the beta-lactamase reporter gene or interference with the assay readout.  In this assay a cell line stably expressing the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter under control of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used.  Changes in BLA expression are monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate.  As designed, a compound that increases FRET is considered a non-selective BLA activator. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with NFAT-BLA were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX-I Supplement, 0.1 mg/mL Zeocin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.25 million/mL in assay media (growth media as above but without Zeocin).  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension were dispensed to each test well of 1536-well plates (1000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 16 hours. After this incubation, test compound in DMSO (0.5% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO only (for negative control wells) was dispensed to the appropriate wells.  Then, 1 microliter of PBS (control wells) or thapsigargin in PBS (positive control wells; 500 nM final concentration) was added to the appropriate control wells. Next, 1 ul of PBS was dispensed into sample field wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, followed by addition of 1 ul per well of the fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol). After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, well fluorescence was measured at 405 nm excitation wavelength and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm using the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland). Prior to normalization, fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ((Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_ Low_Control))*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing PBS High_Control is defined as wells containing 0.5 uM thapsigargin in PBS. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems).  The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e., 56 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 56 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.
