The oncogenic virus Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a well-characterized model system to examine the underlying mechanisms of growth control and cancer. SV40 is also closely related to two viruses, JC and BK virus, which infect humans, and result in morbidity and mortality in immuno-compromised patients. Although it is controversial whether SV40 also causes disease in humans, the virus has been found in specific tumors but not in the surrounding tissue. Unlike BKV and JCV, SV40 grows relatively well in mammalian cell culture systems; moreover, ~10% of the population examined in one study has antibodies against SV40, probably because the first polio vaccines were contaminated with this virus. The long-term effects of SV40 infection in humans are unclear, and there are no approved treatments for any diseases associated with these Polyomaviruses. The oncogenic potential of SV40, JCV, and BKV is recapitulated by a single protein, the large tumor antigen (TAg). TAg is also required for the replication of the virus. In 1997, it was reported that TAg encodes a functional J-domain chaperone. In these and later studies, it was found that mutations that compromise ATP-dependent chaperone function block viral replication and cellular transformation. TAg is also an ATP-dependent helicase, an activity that is required to facilitate the unwinding of DNA during viral replication; therefore, mutations that reduce TAg's endogenous ATPase activity also block viral replication. A bank of in vitro assays for defining TAg functions has been developed. Small molecule modulators that inhibit the chaperone and ATPase activities of TAg have been identified recently. One of these compounds also thwarts the replication of SV40 in infected cells. Chemical modulators of SV40 TAg ATPase activity might represent a new avenue to combat the catastrophic effects of Polyomavirus-associated diseases. To this end, this team has successfully developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of novel Polyomavirus inhibitors. The counter screens for hit toxicity and assay interference, and the secondary assays for target validation will allow a prioritization of "hits" from the primary screen. This assay was conducted with analogs of compounds designated as active in the confirmation and counter screens.  These compounds were evaluated based on % ATPase activity. Those showing <=40% ATPase activity were deemed sufficiently active for continuation to the secondary screen in BSC1 (ATCC CCL-26) cells. Compounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed by the addition of cells.  Cells were grown, and plated in 96-well microplates in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS.  Compounds were added to the cells, followed by 100 TCID50 units of SV40 virus, and the plates were incubated for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. MAL211B was used as a positive control.  Additional wells were included to evaluate the effects of the same concentrations of compounds in the absence of virus.  At the end of the incubation time cells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal in the no virus wells.  Increased cell viability in the virus wells indicates effective compounds.  Compounds that interfere with luciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.  Compounds that show less than 50% toxicity at concentration twice or greater than that of the TAg-IC50 will be considered as active. Data Analysis: 8 cell control wells (- virus) and 8 infected wells (cells + virus) per plate were used to calculate drug efficacy value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. Efficacy was performed in triplicate on each plate, and cytoxicity was performed in duplicate. Results for each concentration were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) of cell viability and was calculated as: 100*(Test Compound - virus control)/(cell control - virus control). From these curves IC50 values were calculated.
