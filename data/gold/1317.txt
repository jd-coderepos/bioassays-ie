The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862) were nonselective due to inhibition of STAT1. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920). In this assay inhibition of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated induction of STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An inhibitor will block IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing luminescence. As designed, test compounds that inhibit STAT1 activity are considered non-selective inhibitors. The inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of well-mixed cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (final nominal IC100 concentration of 300 uM, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80 concentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set as 100% activation) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. Plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
