Addictive behavior stems from abnormal signaling activities in the brain. Thus identification of compounds blocking this modified signaling activity may lead to treatments for addictive behavior. GPR35, a to-date uncharacterized orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, is thought to play a role in addiction and has homology to other known receptors of abuse.  This high-content imaging assay is developed and performed to evaluate selectivity of hits originally identified in "Image-based HTS for Selective Agonists of GPR55 " (AID 1961) and to study the structure-activity relationship on analogs of the confirmed hits. Compounds are either acquired from commercial sources or synthesized internally. The assay will identify small molecule agonists of the GPR35 receptor.  This imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and the GPR35 receptor. Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further into coated pits, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR35 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-Strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 10mM Hepes, and selection antibiotics - 200ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Negative Control Working Solution: 100% DMSO 5) Positive Control Working Solution: Zaprinast (Alexis #ALX-430-020-M010,10mg) 5mM stock in DMSO diluted to 100uM in PBS. 6) Test compounds from dry powder working solution: 10mM in 100% DMSO 7) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 8) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Assay Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Liquid Handler.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 62nM to 32uM (ten doses), in duplicate. b. Positive control was added to column 1. Zaprinast (positive control) final concentration was 10uM.  c. Negative control was added to column 2.  Final DMSO concentration was 0.31% d. DMSO was back-filled to each well to achieve a 0.31% final concentration. 5) Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. 6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings: - 40x 0.6 NA air objective - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm  mission filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters - 4 fields per well for Hit Confirmation 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm with the following analysis settings: NUCLEI DETECTION - Threshold Adjustment:     4 - Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   10 - Minimum Nuclear Area:    200 - Minimum Nuclear Contrast:   0 CYTOPLASM DETECTION - Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment:   0 - Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjustment: 0.05 SPOT DETECTION - Spot Minimum Distance    3 - Spot Peak Radius     0 - Spot Reference Radius    3 - Spot Minimum Contrast    0.26 - Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity   0.5 3) Metrics calculated from NUCLEI IMAGES: Cell Count ("NumberofCellsAnalyzed"), Nuclei Area ("AreaoftheNucleus"), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei ("TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus"), Average Intensity of the Nuclei ("AverageIntensityoftheNucleus") GFP IMAGES: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity"), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots ("TotalSpotIntensity"), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities ("RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity"), Number of Spots per Cell ("AverageSpotsPerCell"), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation ("PercentagePositiveCells") 4)  The "RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity" metric was used to calculate the dose response curves and parameters. IC50 values were calculated using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) employing a sigmoidal dose-response equation through non-linear regression.
