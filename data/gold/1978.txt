Fluorescence polarization-based confirmation biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the serine hydrolase family member Fam108b. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence polarization-based counterscreen for RBBP9 inhibitors: primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the serine hydrolase family member Fam108b" (AID 1947). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)" (AID 1515). In this biochemical assay, recombinant Fam108b protein is incubated with test compounds and FP-Rh probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as Fam 108b inhibitors will prevent Fam 108b-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.51 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 0.625 micromolar of Fam108b protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Catalytically dead Fam108b (S170A) protein (0.625 micromolar) in Assay Buffer was dispensed to positive control wells. Next, 48 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.0.951% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) ) Where: Low_Control is defined as the median value of wells containing Fam108b. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Fam 108b in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing catalytically dead Fam 108b (S170A) protein in the presence of DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter; any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter calculated for the Primary screen was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-3, for inactive 3-0.
