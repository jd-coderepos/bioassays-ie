Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a diverse set of intracellular proteins that modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Their diversity is a result of their localized tissue distribution as well as their preferential regulation of a particular subunit of G protein (Galpha). Following activation by ligand-bound GPCRs, the Galpha subunit undergoes rapid GTP - GDP exchange, and subsequently dissociates from both the GPCR and the G protein beta-gamma subunit (Gbg). Active GTP-bound Galpha (Galpha-GTP) and Gbg further modulate the activity of a number of down-stream intracellular effectors. The duration of G protein signaling is determined by GTP hydrolysis as well as by the re-association of inactive Galpha-GDP with Gbg. Gilman's early work with G-proteins suggested that their intrinsic GTPase activity, typically 2-5 per minute, could not account for the known speed of GPCR signal resolution. This discrepancy was resolved after the discovery of GTPase Accelerating Proteins (GAPs), of which RGS proteins are a subset. The RGS proteins bind directly to Galpha-GTP, accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis, and shorten the lifetime of active G proteins up to several thousand fold. Thus, RGS-Galpha interactions are central to the down-stream regulation of GPCR signaling events. One of the many down stream effectors in G protein signaling pathway is the cell surface intergrin alpha1beta4 (Very Late Antigen-4, VLA4). The stimulation of formyl peptide receptor (FPR, a GPCR) will subsequently activate the VLA4 signaling pathway. Upon activation, VLA4 binds to the specific ligand LDV peptide in a high affinity state with a KD of ~0.2 nanoM rather than 12 nanoM at resting state. This process can be monitored by the fluorescent signal from FITC conjugated LDV peptide. When cells express the non-desensitizing mutant of FPR (FPRdeltaST), the duration of VLA4 activation will largely depend on the length of G protein activation. Human monocyte U937 cells that are a natural host of VLA4 and many RGS proteins and stably transfected with FPRdeltaST have been used to monitor VLA-4 affinity changes in live cell assays. We adapted this system as a cell-based secondary assay to identify potential small molecule RGS/G protein inhibitor candidates revealed in the bead-based multiplexing screen. Inhibitors of the RGS-Galpha interaction have the effect of elongating Galpha signaling; the Galpha signaling pathway can remain #on# for longer periods once activated. Under normal conditions, FPR activation should lead to rapid signal increase followed by return to baseline within 100 seconds after activation. In the presence of an RGS-Galpha inhibitor, VLA4 response time should increase. Although the detection signal in this assay reflects the distal end of the signaling pathway, this novel assay can be used as an indicator of possible cell membrane permeable inhibitors that block RGS-Galpha interactions. Once confirmed, the reversibility and toxicity of the identified compound(s) family will be further evaluated, followed by optimizing probe molecules that regulate RGS protein function in a cellular context.     This assay is an assessment of cell permeability of compounds acting as RGS inhibitors. 500 microL of U937 cells at 1 million cells per microL in RPMI1640 media expressing a non-desentizied mutant of Formyl Peptide Receptor, DeltaST, and a mini magnetic stir bar are added to a FACs tube.  The cells are kept at 37 degrees C under mild stirring at all times. Fluorescence intensity of the cells is collected from the FL1 channel of a BD FACScan Flow cytometer equipped with a 530/30nm bandpath filter. After recording cell autofluorescence for 20sec, 0.5 microL of 4 microM (or 8 microM) LDVFITC is added to the cells. LDV peptide is the specific binding partner of cell surface integrin Alpha4Beta1 (VLA4) with a KD of 12nanoM at the low affinity state of VLA4 and 0.2 nanoM at the high affinity state [Chigaev, et. al, 2001]. The cells are incubated with LDVFITC for 70 sec in order to reach the equilibrium and then activated with either 10 nanoM of fMLF or 10 microM of test compound for an additional 270 sec. Calculations: Due to the temporal nature of this assay, we utilized the area under the curve for assessing differences induced by the RGS hit compounds compared with DMSO. First the background fluorescence measured with 4 nanoM LDVFITC was subtracted from all the data points. Then the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated via the trapezoidal rule from the data collected after the addition of fMLF; AUC = Sum [(time2 - time1)x 0.5 x (MCF2 + MCF2)] where MCF1 is the Mean Channel Fluorescence in FL1 measured at time equal to time1, and MCF2 is the Mean Channel Fluorescence measured at time equal to time2. The comparison between the effect of the compound and DMSO was calculated by ratio of the respective AUCs: Response = 100 x |(AUC_Cmpd/AUC_DMSO) -1| where AUC_Cmpd is the area under the curve in the presence of tester compound and AUC_DMSO is the area under the curve in the presense of carrier, DMSO.  The AUC_DMSO for this experiment was 20093 MCF-sec.  The Response value is the same as the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE. An active compound have a Response greater than or equal to 25. Annotations of interference of the assay due to innate fluorescence of the compound was made in the column titled PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT. For most of these fluorescent compound, the binding data for LDVFITC were quenched, therefore not yielding any productive data.
