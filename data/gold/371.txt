Compounds that inhibit tumor cell growth may have cytotoxic or cytostatic effects and vary widely in structure and mechanism of action.  Cancer chemotherapeutic drugs inhibit tumor cell growth by disrupting cell division or other mechanisms, which often results in apoptotic cell death.  The ability of a compound to inhibit the growth of the human non-small cell lung tumor line, A549, is a preliminary indication of anticancer activity for treating patients with lung cancer.  In order to screen a structurally diverse library of compounds for tumor cell growth inhibitory activity, we implemented a high throughput screening assay to measure viable cell number.  Numerous classes of compounds may cause cytotoxicity by perturbing a variety of intracellular signaling pathways, interfering with mitosis, or disrupting various aspects of cell function, which will result in the reduction of viable cell number, which can be measured by a variety of endpoints such as metabolic activity and ATP levels. Cultured human A549 lung tumor cells were treated with test compounds from a 3317 compound library for 72 hours at a final concentration of 10 uM.  Following treatment, ATP was measured using a commercially available assay (Cell Titer Glo, Promega).  The assay involves a recombinant luciferase enzyme that converts luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of Mg ions, oxygen, and ATP, and is accompanied by the emission of light, or chemiluminsence.  Each plate contained 32 replicates of untreated cells which served as a negative control and 32 replicates of cells treated with doxorubicin at 5 uM, which served as the positive control.  Average growth inhibition values were calculated based on two separate experiments.  Compounds showing an average percent growth inhibition value of 50% or greater were scored as active, while compounds which cause less than 50% growth inhibition were scored as inactive.
