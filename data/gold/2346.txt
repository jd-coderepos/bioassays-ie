Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized analogues. Pandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune cell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function. The purpose of this assay is to confirm S1P4 antagonist dose response of synthesized compounds. This assay uses Tango S1P4-BLA U2OS cells which contain the human Endothelial Differentiation Gene 6 (EDG6; S1P4) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P4 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P4 antagonists will inhibit S1P4 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy's 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, and 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1,000,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 10 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 2% BSA (0.22 micromolar final nominal EC80 concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm / I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( ( Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem activity score for active compounds is 100-1, there are no inactives.
