BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein 1) is a member of the Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB). These proteases reverse the conjugation of ubiquitin to targeted proteins. The importance of ubiquitin conjugation in many cellular processes suggests a critical role of DUBs in normal physiology and potentially in pathological conditions. In order to confirm the activity of hit compounds from the primary assay, an HPLC-based, end-point enzyme activity assay was developed. The assay monitors the hydrolysis of a simple ubiquitin conjugate (Ub-ethyl ester) by BAP1, leading to the release of free Ub.  After the reaction is quenched, the amounts of both Ub and UbEE present are quantified by reverse-phase HPLC.  The ratio of Ub and UbEE peak heights was used to determine % conversion (i.e. the conversion of UbEE to Ub), which reflects BAP1 activity.   10x assay buffer buffer (1x = 50 mM Tris HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM DTT, pH 7.5) Purified BAP1 (provided by investigator) Ub-ethyl ester (UbEE) substrate (2.2 mg/mL, provided by investigator) Test compounds (1 mM in 100% DMSO) 400 mM HCl Reaction procedure: 1. Reactions were prepared in 4 96-well round-bottom plates. 2. Prepare compound working stocks in 96-well plates (dilute 1mM compound 1:5 in 1x assay buffer). 3. Prepare BAP1 working stock (1uM) in 1x assay buffer 4. Prepare reaction plates in the following order (amounts per reaction): a. 10 uL dH2O b. 2 uL 10x assay buffer c. 2 uL BAP1 d. 2 uL compound (final [compound] = 20 uM) i. Control reactions received DMSO alone.  5. Preincubate substrate and compound for 5-10 minutes 6. Add 2 uL/well UbEE 7. Incubate plates at RT for 20 min. 8. Quench reactions by adding 4 uL 400mM HCl/well 9. Store reactions at -20C until analysis. HPLC procedure: Reactions (4 uL) were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Gilson HPLC using a 30 mm column (internal diameter = 2.1 mm, particle size = 3 um) Mobile phase = 52% B:48% A Buffer A = 40 mM sodium perchlorate + 0.1% perchloric acid Buffer B =  Buffer A + 75% acetonitrile 1 mL/min flow rate, 4-6 min run time.  Controls include: t = 0 (add HCl with substrate), DMSO-only (negative control), Ub-vinyl sulfone (known inhibitor = positive control).  Purified Ub and UbEE were used as retention time controls. Data analysis: Retention time, peak height, and peak area were determined for both Ub and UbEE using UniPoint software v. 5.11 (Gilson).  Compounds with Ub/UbEE peak height ratio >125% were discarded (7 total compounds). These compounds are labeled as inactive. For each compound, % conversion was determined based on peak heights: % conversion = [Ub/(Ub+UbEE)] * 100 Where appropriate, chromatograms were analyzed by hand to confirm results or if a potential hit had been overlooked because of integration program settings.  Peak area data has been omitted for these samples. For each compound, % control was calculated as the ratio of the compound % conversion to the mean % conversion for the plate. Compounds with % control less than or equal to 60% were identified as active. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was obtained by normalizing the % conversion values obtained between 100 and 0, with 100 corresponding to the lowest % conversion, and 0 to the highest % conversion, according to the formula: SCORE = 100 * (1-((Value - LowestConversion) / (HighestConversion - LowestConversion)))
