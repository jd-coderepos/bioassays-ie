Late stage results from the probe development effort to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma Binding Protein 9 (RBBP9): Gel-based Activity-Based Protein Profiling (ABPP) Inhibition. The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein controls cell cycle progression by regulating the activity of the transcription factor E2F (1), which activates genes essential for DNA replication. Due to the critical role of RB in regulating the cell cycle, factors that bind and regulate RB activity are considered valuable targets for preventing tumorigenesis. One such protein, RB binding protein 9 (RBBP9), is widely expressed in different tissues and upregulated in certain tumors (2, 3). The RBBP9 protein contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, which belongs to the DUF1234 domain superfamily of unknown function. Although an enzymatic activity of RBBP9 has not been reported, this protein does react with activity-based probes that target serine hydrolases, suggesting that it is a functional enzyme. Also consistent with this premise, the crystal structure of RBBP9 was recently solved and revealed a well-structured active site with a properly arranged catalytic triad (4). A role for RBBP9 in cellular transformation is supported by studies showing that RBBP9 mRNA expression is increased in transformed rat liver cell lines and human liver tumor biopsies (3). Furthermore, RBBP9-overexpressing cells form tumors when implanted into immuno-deficient mice (3), and RBBP9 overexpression confers resistance to TGF-&#946;1-induced growth inhibition through its interaction with Rb and displacement of E2F (3, 5). RBBP9 is also suggested to play a role in gender-related differential responses to radiation-induced cell proliferation (6). As a result, the identification of compounds that selectively inhibit RBBP9 activity may provide valuable probes for the study of apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis. This gel-based activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) inhibition assay was performed as part of a probe development effort to identify inhibitor probes of RBBP9 belonging to the oxime ester scaffold. Please see AIDs 1515 and 1537, Summary AID 1790, and below for all protocols performed in this probe development effort. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in the uHTS primary (AID 1515) and confirmation screens (AID 1537). In this assay, a fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase family is used to label RBBP9 in the presence of test compounds. The reaction products are separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized in-gel using a flatbed fluorescence scanner. The percentage activity remaining is determined by measuring the integrated optical density of the bands. As designed, test compounds that act as RBBP9 inhibitors will prevent RBBP9-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe, leading to low fluorescence polarization in the band in the gel. Percent inhibition of recombinant RBBP9 (compound at 20 uM) was determined. Protocol Summary: Recombinant RBBP9 (2 mM) in assay buffer was incubated with DMSO or compound (20 mM) for 30 min at 25 degrees Celsius before the addition of FP-rhodamine at a final concentration of 75 nM in 50 ml total reaction volume. The reaction was incubated for 45 min at 25 degrees Celsius, quenched with 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min at 90 degrees Celsius, separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized in-gel. The percentage activity remaining was determined by measuring the integrated optical density of the bands.
