Assay Rationale and Summary: Salmonella is a genus of rod-shaped Gram-negative enterobacteria that causes typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and foodborne illness. Salmonella enterica, serovar Typhimurium, is a leading cause of human gastroenteritis (acute intestinal inflammation), and is used as a mouse model of human typhoid fever. Serovar Typhi is the cause of the human disease typhoid fever. Every year, approximately 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States. Because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of infections may be thirty or more times greater. The most recent outbreak in the US occurred in April, 2008. Young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are the most likely to develop severe infections. The rate of diagnosed infections in children less than five years old is about five times higher than the rate in all other persons. The incidence of non-typhoid salmonellosis is increasing worldwide, causing millions of infections and many deaths in the human population each year. S. typhi infections occur worldwide but primarily in developing nations where sanitary conditions are poor. Early antibiotic therapy has transformed a previously life-threatening illness of several weeks' duration with an overall mortality rate approaching 20% into a short-term febrile illness with negligible mortality. However, case fatality rates of 10-50% have been reported from endemic countries when diagnosis is delayed. Typhoid fevers are endemic in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, affects 13-17 million people yearly, and kills an estimated 600,000. The PhoP regulon is a major regulator of virulence in Salmonella that also controls the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments. The PhoP system enables Salmonella to determine its presence in an intracellular or extracellular environment, and to promote the expression of genes required for survival within or entry into host cells, respectively. The DNA sequence for the PhoP locus indicates that it is composed of two genes present in an operon, termed phoP and phoQ. The gene products are members of bacterial two-component transcriptional regulators that respond to environmental stimuli, and regulate the expression of genes involved in virulence and macrophage survival of S. enterica. During the past year the assay provider's group has constructed and evaluated multiple PhoP-activated promoter-reporter fusions and compared these results with the relative abundance of gene transcripts in wild-type serovar Typhi. They also evaluated PhoP-independent as well as PhoP-repressed promoter-reporter constructs in PhoP-non-inducing versus inducing conditions for each of the promoters. He has used these reporters in Salmonella serovar Typhi to create a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for identifying compounds that specifically inhibit PhoP induction. To this end, our team has developed a 1536-well high-throughput screen suitable for the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of the PhoP virulence regulon of S. enterica which may lead to the identification of novel strategies to inhibit the intracellular persistence of bacterial infection. The proposed primary assays, counter screens, and secondary assays, which utilize quantitative, established techniques, will allow identification of hits, confirmation of target specificity, and the prioritization of assay chemical probes. The primary screening GFP expression assay in Salmonella typhi was used to determine PhoP regulation by measuring expression of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene fused to the promoter for PhoP. During bacterial growth, fluorescence was determined in PhoP inducing (low Mg2+, 10uM) conditions in the presence of test compounds. Controls included (high Mg2+, 10mM) to simulate compounds that would repress PhoP. Primary Assay Conditions:  The assay was conducted in 1536-well black, clear-bottom microplates. Media for the S. typhi virK-GFP and nmpC-GFP consisted of 1X standard M9MM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 0.0021% Tryptophan, 0.0037% Cysteine, 0.0016% Histidine, 0055% Thymidine, 0.00169% Thiamine, 5uM FeSO4, and 20uM CaCl2.  Initially, 25nl of test compound (50uM final concentration) in 100% DMSO was added to the respective plate wells. Compounds were dispensed using an Echo 550 Series Liquid Handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA). Culture and media volumes were dispensed using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).  Cultures were grown overnight in media containing 2mM MgCl2.  The next morning, 20 ml of the overnight culture was centrifuged, washed in media without MgCl2, then inoculated into 150ml of media containing either 10uM MgCl2 (for PhoP-GFP induction) or 10mM MgCl2 (for PhoP-GFP suppression), and grown to an OD of approximately 0.2.  The cultures were then dispensed into the plates (preplated with compounds, final compound concentration was 50uM) and incubated for 4h at 37C.  Final DMSO concentration was 1%.  Endpoint addition and read:  After incubation, the plates were bottom-read for fluorescence intensity using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and excitation/emission at 480/535nm respectively. Controls and Drug Addition: Controls included high/low Mg2+ (10mM/10uM) wells (media and DMSO blank).  No control drug was available for this assay, so high Mg2+ simulated compounds that would repress the PhoP gene and reduce GFP expression.  25nl of compounds in 100% DMSO were dispensed into the 1536-well plates using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA), for a final concentration of 50uM. DMSO concentration was maintained at 1% for all wells of each plate. Data Analysis: 128 high Mg2+ wells and 128 low Mg2+ wells per plate were used to calculate Z' value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. The overall Z Factor for the primary assay was 0.7.  Data were analyzed using the IDBS Activity Base software. Results for each concentration were expressed as percent inhibition (% Inhibition) and was calculated as: 100*(Test Compound - Low Mg2+ Control)/(High Mg2+ Control - Low Mg2+ Control). The dose response data was analyzed using a four parameter logistic fit to the data (XLFit equation 205) with the maximum and minimum locked at 100 and 0. From these curves IC50 values were calculated.
