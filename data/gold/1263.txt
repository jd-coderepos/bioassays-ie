The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors transduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli and are important mediators of inflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (1, 2). STATs are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are phosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear translocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although structurally similar, members of the STAT family (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess diverse biological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and anti-proliferative, while STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is largely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved in IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus STAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Currently available STAT1 modulators mediate modest effects on STAT-induced transcription, act indirectly by targeting JAK or other kinases activities, or are associated with adverse hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects (6, 7).  The liabilities of the current state of the art for STAT1 modulators necessitate the discovery of higher affinity probes.  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes associated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective modulators of STAT1 activity may lead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 920; 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862). In this assay inhibition of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 antagonist will block IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing luminescence. The STAT1 antagonist and potentiator confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of well-mixed cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates.  The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (final nominal IC100 concentration of 300 uM, set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration).  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80 concentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set as 100% activation) was dispensed into sample and all control wells.  Plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
