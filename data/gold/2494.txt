The caspases (Cysteine Aspartyl Protease) comprise a related family of 14 dimeric proteases that are critical mediators of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inflammation. The caspases represent an important class of drug targets for stroke, ischemia, cancer and inflammatory diseases. Comparison of crystal structures of procaspases and caspases have revealed that the subunits of the homodimer are composed of subdomains which have highly conserved architecture and mechanism, and show large structural transitions between procaspase and active conformers. One goal of this project was to identify compounds that act as allosteric inhibitors via stabilizing the procaspase form of the enzyme. Previous work in Well's laboratory has shown that such allosteric inhibitors can be identified and these act by binding at the dimer interface of enzyme. The biochemical assay was configured using purified caspase 1 at a high enzyme concentration to promote formation of the homodimers and thus facilitate the identification of allosteric inhibitors. The overall goal was to identify reversible inhibitors with better drug-like properties than the currently available set of aspartyl-containing peptidomimetics that covalently bind the active site. Caspase 1 was assayed using the profluorescent substrate Ac-WEHD-AFC. After initiation of the assay with substrate the plates were rapidly read using an automated robotic system (Kalypsys, Inc.) to maintain consistent timing. A kinetic mode of detection was used where the initial rate was collected (estimated final product formation was ~10%). Compounds were screened as a concentration-titration series that ranged from 57 uM to 0.7 nM. Below is the protocol used for caspase 1. Caspase-1 was dispensed (3 mL) into a 1536-well black solid-bottom microplate (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, USA) using a Bio-RAPTR (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) nanoliter dispenser for automated addition of reagents, to give a final enzyme concentration of 2 nM. Assay buffer was 50 mM HEPES, pH7.4, containing 1M sodium citrate, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 0.01% CHAPS, 1% DMSO, and 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA). Aliquots of test compound (23 nL) from a DMSO stock solution were transferred to the enzyme-containing wells using a pintool transfer station (Kalypsys Inc., San Diego, USA), and the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Each compound was added as a 12-point titration in duplicate. Substrate was dispensed (1 mL) to give a final caged fluorescent peptide substrate (Ac-LEHD-AMC) concentration of 5 mm, and the initial reaction rate was monitored over 20 min at room temperature. Free AMC was measured by fluorescence detection (lex=340 nm, lem=450) with a ViewLux charge-coupled device-based imager (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA). Percent inhibition was calculated from the median values of the uninhibited and the uncatalyzed controls, and IC50 values were determined by fitting the concentration-response data with a four-parameter Hill equation as previously described (http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/pub/openhts/curvefit/).
