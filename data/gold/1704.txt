Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC) activity. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304), and inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (PubChem AID 1359) were nonselective. In this assay, the parental HEK293 cell line transfected with a cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channel (CNGC)-based cAMP sensor is used to measure inhibition of isoproterenol-induced CNGC activity by test compound. Isoproterenol is a nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. CNGC activation will change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an inhibitor of cAMP production or an inhibitor of the CNGC will lead to reduced CNGC opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The HEK293-CNG parental cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of 0.1% BSA was dispensed to all wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.4% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration) to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using: % Inhibition = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of a DMSO assay plate of wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 21 and active compounds range of activity score is 21 to 100.
