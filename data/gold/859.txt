The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. The purpose of this screen was to test confirmed primary hits from the M1 Antagonist Screen for their ability to dose-dependently elicit a response at the rat M1 receptor under assay conditions similar to the primary screen. 1. Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells containing M1 receptor (ATCC#CRL-1985) were plated at 10,000 cells/well in assay media (F12 (Ham), 10% FBS, 2 mM GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 20 mM HEPES) in 384 well plates. 2. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. 3. Media was removed and assay buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 20 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 2.0 uM Fluo4-AM dye (Invitrogen) was added. 4. Cells were incubated for 45 minutes (37 degrees C, 5% CO2) for dye loading. 5. Cell plates were loaded into the Hamamatsu FDSS equipped with 480 nm excitation and 540 nmemission filters. 6. Test compound in assay buffer + 0.3 percent DMSO was added at 5 seconds (compound add step) simultaneously the plate was kinetically imaged. 7. Subsequently, approximately 8 nM acetylcholine (EC80) in assay buffer was added at 197 seconds (agonist stimulation step) and imaging continued for a total of 4 minutes acquisition time. 8. 0.3% DMSO, compound vehicle, and an atropine concentration series were added to each plate as controls for the compound add step. Additionally, assay buffer, 8nM acetylcholine (EC80) and 80nM acetylcholine (ECMAX) were added as controls at the time of agonist stimulation. 9. Test compounds were tested at 10 different concentrations resulting from 1 to 3 serial dilutions spanning the concentration range of 15 uM to 0.76 nM. Each compound concentration series was tested in triplicate. 1.  Maximum fluorescence signal was selected from the time window ranging from 200 seconds to 210 seconds. 2.  The average fluorescence signal between 180 and 190 seconds was used as a baseline value. 3.  The #value# for each well was determined as the difference of the max signal minus the average baseline. 4.  The values for each dose-response curve for each compound were treated as a group and fit to a variable-slope sigmoidal curve using Pipeline Pilot and the R-statistics package #drc# module. 5.  Plate-based control statistics were calculated using Pipeline Pilot. 6.  Replicate group measurements for each compound were treated independently rather than averaged over the replicates. 7.  Individual curves were classified into a #fit category# as either #fit,# #trend,# or #no fit.# #No fit# was used to describe groups where the curve fit did not converge.  #Fit# was used to describe groups where three or more actual data points lay on both sides of the calculated EC50. In cases where two or fewer data points were on either side of the EC50, the group was called a #trend.# This was done to acknowledge the increased uncertainty in curves where the calculated EC50 is less reliable. 8.  The overall activity outcome is an aggregate of all successful fits.  If a plurality of the replicates for a compound resulted in a fit or a trend, that compound was considered active. 9.  The activity score was assigned as 100 when 2 or 3 out of the 3 replicates were considered #fit.# The score was assigned as 50 when 2 or 3 of 3 replicates were considered #trend# or if one #fit,# one #trend,# and one #no fit# existed for a set of replicates.  A score of 0 was assigned when fewer than 2 of 3 replicates gave either #fit# or #trend.#
