Dose response biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)" (PubChem AID 731).  Additionally, compounds selected for testing in this AID were not active or exhibited at least a 3-fold lower % Activation value (compared to AID 731) in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) recruitment by PPARgamma," (PubChem AID 631) and "Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by PPARgamma," (PubChem AID 1032). This assay tests the ability of compounds to increase the interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC-3, as measured using Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer(TR-FRET) between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC-3 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively.  Compounds that promote the association of SRC-3 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing TR-FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase TR-FRET.  Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 80 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of TR-FRET assay buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates.  The remaining 46 columns were filled with 5 ul of TR-FRET assay buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL of anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL of anti-FLAG APC, 4 nM of GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 35 nM of FLAG-tagged SRC-3 protein [aa 601-762]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing 40 nL of GW1929 (8 uM final nominal concentration), test compounds, or DMSO (0.8% final DMSO concentration) to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 15 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and fluorescence was measured.  After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000 Where I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows: % Activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where: TestCompound is defined as wells containing test compound. LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO. HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929. For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 80 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 80 uM. Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.
