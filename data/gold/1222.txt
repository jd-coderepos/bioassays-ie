The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fulfills multiple cellular functions (reviewed in [1-4]).  The lumen of the ER contains high concentration of Ca2+ due to the transport of calcium ions into the ER by Ca2+-ATPases.  The lumen possesses an oxidative environment, critical for formation of disulfide-bonds and proper folding of proteins destined for secretion or display on the cell surface.  Because of its role in protein folding and transport, the ER is also rich in Ca2+-dependent molecular chaperones, such as Grp78, Grp94, and calreticulin, which help stabilize protein folding intermediates. This work's aim is to identify chemical compounds that inhibit cell death induced by ER stress using a cell-based survival assay. Using secondary assays, selectivity of these compounds for the ER stress pathway was defined, and the principal signaling events that are inhibited were dissected. Thapsigargin (TG) was used to induce ER stress, resulting in cell death. Salubrinal, a known chemical inhibitor of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) dephosphorylation, was used as compound/positive control in this sceen. Negative control: thapsigargin in 0.56% DMSO Positive control: 5% DMSO Primary screening protocol 1) Undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells were maintained in complete media at 32C. * Tissue culture complete media: DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 I.U./ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Amphotericin 2) CSM14.1 cells were recovered from cultures by trypsinization, and seeded in 384 well plates (greiner #781098) at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 20 ul of DMEM medium containing 2% FBS, and the same concentration of antibiotics as in step 1. Seeding was performed using a Thermo WellMate bulk reagent dispenser.  Plates were incubated overnight at 32C. 3) Using a Biomek FX liquid handler (Beckman Coulter), 6 uL of 0.1 mM test compounds in 5% DMSO were added to wells in columns 3-24 of the 384 well plates (leaving columns 1 and 2 empty) to achieve an approximate final concentration of 20 uM of test compound and a final concentration of 1% DMSO at this point. 4) 6 uL of 5% DMSO was added to wells corresponding to columns 1&2. 5) The plates were returned to the incubator for 2 hours. 6) A multidrop combi bulk reagent dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to dispense 4 uL per well of thapsigargin solution in columns 2-24, thus achieving a final concentration of ~15 uM TG 7) 4ul of tissue culture media containing 0.56% DMSO was transferred manually to column 1 using a 16 channel electronic pipet. 8) The plates were returned to the incubator overnight (18-22hrs). 9) 13 uL of ATPlite solution was dispensed per well using a WellMate bulk reagent dispenser. 10) Within 30 minutes, ATP luminescence was evaluated using an Envision multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer) in the ultra-sensitive luminescence mode. 11) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc). Secondary screening protocol 1) Undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells were maintained in complete media at 32C. * Tissue culture complete media: DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 I.U./ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Amphotericin 2) CSM14.1 cells were recovered from cultures by trypsinization, and seeded in 384 well plates (greiner #781098) at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 20 ul of DMEM medium containing 2% FBS, and the same concentration of antibiotics as in step 1. Seeding was performed using a Thermo WellMate bulk reagent dispenser.  Plates were incubated overnight at 32C. 3) Dose-response curves contained 10 concentrations of compounds obtained using a 2-fold serial dilution. Compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO, and then diluted with water to 10% final DMSO concentration. 4) Using a Biomek FX liquid handler (Beckman Coulter), 6 uL of the serially diluted compounds in 5% DMSO were added to wells in columns 3-24 of the 384 well plates 5) 6 uL of 5% DMSO was added to wells corresponding to columns 1&2. 6) The plates were returned to the incubator for 2 hours. 7) A multidrop combi bulk reagent dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to dispense 4 uL per well of thapsigargin solution in columns 2-24, thus achieving a final concentration of ~15 uM TG 8) 4ul of tissue culture media containing 0.56% DMSO was transferred manually to column 1 using a 16 channel electronic pipet. 9) The plates were returned to the incubator overnight (18-22hrs). 10) 13 uL of ATPlite solution was dispensed per well using a WellMate bulk reagent dispenser. 11) Within 30 minutes, ATP luminescence was evaluated using an Envision multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer) in the ultra-sensitive luminescence mode. 12) Data analysis was performed using CBIS software (ChemInnovations, Inc).
