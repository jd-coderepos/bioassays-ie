The human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family is evolutionarily conserved among all organisms from archaebacteria to humans, suggesting an essential role in cell survival (1, 2). Under circumstances of transient cell stress, the heat shock response and activities of molecular chaperones can restore protein homeostasis. In human disease, however, misfolded proteins can accumulate when polyglutamine-expansion proteins are chronically expressed over the life of the cell. Elevated expression of molecular chaperones suppresses protein misfolding/aggregation and toxicity phenotypes in various model systems of Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the respective proteins huntingtin, tau, alpha-synuclein, and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), associated with these diseases, result in the appearance of misfolded species that adopt alternate conformations. These observations led to the proposal that a common feature of diverse diseases of protein conformation is the appearance of alternate folded states that self-associate and form toxic species and protein aggregates. A role for Hsp70 family proteins in controlling these events has been widely studied. Studies with mammalian tissue culture cells, transgenic mice, Drosophila, and C. elegans have established that the heat shock response can be activated in cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins, suggesting a role for molecular chaperones as an adaptive survival response (3, 4). Moreover, a direct relationship with polyglutamine diseases is suggested by the co-localization of several heat shock proteins, including Hdj-1, Hdj-2, Hsp70 and ubiquitin with polyglutamine aggregates in the tissues of affected individuals, transgenic mice and tissue culture cells (5). Finally, overexpression of Hsp70 can suppress the toxicity associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins (6-8). High throughput screening initiatives aimed at the identification of compounds that enhance the heat shock response, in particular Hsp70, will provide insights into this conserved cellular process and may lead to novel therapeutics for these devastating disorders.  The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for test compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)" (PubChem AID 1203). In this assay induction of the heat shock response by test compound is measured in a HeLa cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter under control of the human Hsp70 promoter.  As designed, a compound that activates the Hsp70 promoter will increase luciferase transcription, and thus increase well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The hsp70.1pr-luc HeLa cell line was routinely cultured in tissue culture flasks in growth media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1% pen-strep-neomycin antibiotic mixture and 1% Geneticin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH).  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended in growth media at a concentration of 750,000 cells/mL. Next, 5 ul of cell suspension were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates (3,750 cells per well). After incubation for 4 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, the assay was started by dispensing 50 nL of test compound in DMSO to sample wells, DMSO alone (1% final concentration) to negative control wells, or MG132 (final nominal EC100 concentration of 30 uM, set as 100% activation) to positive control wells. The plates were then incubated for 16 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
