The pharmacological treatment of neurodegenerative disorders has been a disappointment when compared to the successes obtained in stroke, other neurological diseases like seizures, and in mental health diseases. It has to be said that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and their early diagnosis represent a definite obstacle to effective intervention. Nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) is a key cellular signaling factor in the central nervous system. Although NF-kB signaling pathways have been extensively investigated in cancer and in immunological diseases, NF-kB role in the central nervous system physiology and pathology in non inflammatory disorders of the brain is still unclear. NF-kB has an important role as an inhibitor of neuronal apoptosis and at least in this capacity it represents an interesting target to pursue. Recent evidence has also pointed out that this signaling system is involved in the resilience of neurons and in their ability to survive disparate insults. Functional knock out models of NF-kB, achieved via over-expression of its natural repressor I-kB, have shown that neurons from these animals are more sensitive to insults including trauma, Beta-amyloid toxicity and excitotoxicity. Also a direct neuroprotective effect from both non apoptotic and apoptotic models of neurodegeneration has been attributed to direct or indirect activation of NF-kB signaling. In addition, to the direct neuroprotective effect NF-kB up-regulation could also be of value in improving learning and memory. In fact, NF-kB signaling has been shown to improve long term potentiation and long term depression, two models of learning at cellular level. This background is of great appeal because up regulation of NF-kB in neurons could be useful in attacking, at the same time, neuronal degeneration and deterioration of neuronal functions associated with loss of learning and memory as seen in Alzheimer#s disease. To pursue this scope, we have set up a novel human cell-based assay to identify small molecules able to up-regulate NF-kB expression for high throughput screening. The cell line developed for this assay, which is used to identify pharmacological probes for the activation of NF-kB, was prepared as follows. The SH-5YSY human neuroblastoma cell line was doubly stably transfected with a reporter construct coding the human NF-kB promoter driving the expression of the firefly luciferase and a reporter coding the resistance to the antibiotic blasticidin. TNF-alpha was used as a positive control as it a potent enhancer of NF-kB expression.  Negative control wells were treated with vehicle only. Cell Culture:  SH-5YSY (ATCC) cells stably transfected with a reporter construct containing the human NF-kB promoter fused upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter and blasticidin resistance (clone C1) were subcultured every 3-4 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM) high glucose (1X) with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate + 10% FBS + 3 ug/mL of blasticidin, and incubated at 37C in 5% CO2, and maintained at a subconfluent density of no more than 240,000 cells/cm2 for less than 30 passages.
