A cell line containing the human S1P1 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1 activation. Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism was measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases the production of cAMP and therefore the transcription of the CRE-BLA reporter gene. S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect; similarly agonism potentiators would increase the potency of an S1P1 agonist. Therefore the amount of BLA activity was inversely proportional to the concentration of agonist or agonism potentiators in the presence of an S1P1 agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. To discover both S1P1 agonists and agonism potentiators, the primary uHTS campaign was run in "potentiator" mode, described as follows. All compounds were tested in the presence of the EC20 (2 nM) of the S1P1-selective agonist SEW2871 and the EC80 (4 micromolar) of forskolin. The EC20 of SEW2871 was used in order to identify both S1P1 agonists and agonism potentiators. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained the EC100 of SEW2871 (1 micromolar) and the EC80 of forskolin. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration. For all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line was used, stably transfected with human S1P1 receptor (pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct. Cells were cultured in T-175 cm2 Corning flasks (part#431080) at 37 degrees C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen# part#11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone part#SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen part#1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen part#11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen# part#15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen part#25030-081), 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen part#10131-027), and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen part#15140-122). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle#s Media (Invitrogen part#21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone part#SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, and 5mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and SEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar (forskolin's EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871's EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871 was also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e. its EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer#part#K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma part#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.
