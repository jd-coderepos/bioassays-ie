In this assay inhibition of NF-kB transcription was measured using a human HEK 293T cell line that stably expresses a human NF-kB::luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce TNF-alpha-mediated induction of NF-kB::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with TNF-alpha to activate NF-kB transcription. Changes in NF-kB::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An inhibitor will block TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kB transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that inhibit NF-kB activity are considered non-selective inhibitors. The inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using NF-kB::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. HEK 293T cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 ug/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 ug/mL neomycin and 1 ug/mL of puromycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 0.94 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (3,760 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere to plates by incubation at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 18 hours. The assay was started by dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received MG-132 (100 uM final nominal concentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 0% inhibition). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, 95% RH. Next, 1 ul of human recombinant TNF-alpha (5.6 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and control wells. This TNF-alpha concentration resulted in approximately 80% NF-kappaB::luciferase reporter activity. Next, the plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH. The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
