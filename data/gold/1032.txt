Pimary biochemical High Throughput Screening assay for agonists of the steroid receptor coactivator 2 (SRC-2) recruitment by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). In this primary homogeneous coactivator assay compounds from the MLSMR were tested for their ability to increase interactions between PPARg and its coactivator SRC2, as measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Energy Transfer (TR-FRET). The assay is based on the efficient FRET between a GST-PPARg ligand binding domain (LBD) fusion protein and a FLAG-tagged SRC2 coactivator. The fusion protein and coactivator are each recognized by fluorophore-labeled antibodies: anti-GST Europium Kryptate (EuK) donor and anti-FLAG Allophycocyanin (APC) acceptor, respectively. Compounds that act as agonist ligands that promote the association of SRC2 with PPARg will shorten the distance between the two entities, allowing FRET to occur between the associated antibodies. As designed, a compound that acts as an agonist will increase the fluorescence at the acceptor emission wavelength. Prior to the start of the assay five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer (125 mM Potassium Fluoride, 100mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.0, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with five microliters of TR-FRET Assay Buffer supplemented with 150 ng/mL anti-GST EuK, 3 micrograms/mL anti-FLAG APC, 2 nM GST-tagged PPARg-LBD [aa 204-477] and 40 nM FLAG-tagged SRC2 protein [aa 624-829]. Next, the plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. The assay was started by dispensing forty nanoliters of GW1929 (8 micromolar final nominal concentration), test compounds (8 micromolar final nominal concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated at 4 degrees Celsius for 15 hours. Next, the plates were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 minutes before being centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (EuK) and 671 nm (APC) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). Values measured from both wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I671 nm / I617 nm x 10,000 Where, I671 nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm and I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm. The percent activation for each compound is calculated as follows: % activation = 100 x ((Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_LowControl) / (Median_Ratio_HighControl - Median_Ratio_LowControl)) Where, TestCompound is defined as wells containing MLSMR compound, LowControl is defined as wells containing DMSO, and HighControl is defined as wells containing GW1929 A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.
