Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the G-protein coupled receptor 7 (GPR7). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that inhibit GPR7 activity. Although GPR7 is naturally coupled to G&#945;i, which decreases cAMP levels upon activation, this assay employs a chimeric cell line that forces the receptor to use Gqi3, and therefore the assay readout is calcium release. In this assay HEK cells stably co-transfected with the human GPR7 receptor and G&#945;qi3 (hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as GPR7 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.4 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The hGPR7 HEK293T/Gqi3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Hygromycin-B, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 0.625 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 1500 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 22 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of GPR7 agonist (2 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 180 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 185 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Inhibition = [ 1 - ((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))]*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPW. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary Screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The PubChem Activity Score has been set to 100 for active compounds and 0 for inactive compounds.
