TR-FRET counterscreen for FAK inhibitors: dose-response biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2). The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay for inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)" (PubChem AID 727), that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation biochemical assay for inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)" (PubChem AID 794), and that were active in a set of experiments entitled, "Dose-response biochemical assay for inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)" (PubChem AID 810), were nonselective inhibitors due to inhibition of PYK2. In this time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based assay, PYK2-mediated phosphorylation of a poly Glu-Tyr (poly-GT) substrate is monitored using a FRET acceptor dye which is coupled directly to the substrate. Substrate phosphorylation by PYK2 is detected with a specific europium-labeled anti-phospho-tyrosine PY20 antibody (Eu-Ab), which serves as the FRET donor. Upon phosphorylation, the recognition and binding of Eu-Ab to phosphorylated tyrosines of the substrate bring the donor and acceptor dyes into close proximity, allowing FRET to occur. As designed, a compound that acts as a PYK inhibitor will prevent PYK2-mediated substrate phosphorylation, thereby preventing the binding of the Eu-Ab to phospho-tyrosine residues and well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 70 uM. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 ul/well of a solution containing 200 nM ULight poly GT (4:1) substrate and 60 uM ATP in kinase buffer were dispensed into black 1536-well solid bottom non-treated microtiter plates. Next, 35 nL of test compound in DMSO, DMSO alone (0.7% final concentration) or staurosporine (143 uM IC100 (1 uM Final) concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 ul of 200 nM PYK2 enzyme in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Tween, 2 mM DTT, final pH 7.0) . After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 5 ul of 1X LANCE detection buffer supplemented with 20 mM EDTA and 4 nM Eu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab were added to each well. Plates were then incubated 30 minutes at room temperature. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (PerkinElmer). To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl) / (Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl)))*100 Where: TestCompound = Wells containing test compound. LowControl = Wells containing DMSO. HighControl = Wells containing staurosporine. For each compound percent inhibition was plotted against test compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 70 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually. Compounds with IC50 of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 39 and active compounds range of activity score is 40 to 100.
