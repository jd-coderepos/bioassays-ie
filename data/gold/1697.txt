Fluorescence confirmation assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify agonists of NPY-Y1. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304), and inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2," (PubChem AID 1359), acted as agonists of NPY-Y1. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y1 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure direct agonism of the Y1 receptor by test compound in the absence of the agonist, NPY. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an agonist of Y1 will increase Y1 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. Protocol Summary: The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), and then 2 ul of NPY in 0.1% BSA or 0.1% BSA alone was dispensed to the appropriate wells. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final DMSO concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 uM final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 uM final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 0.1% BSA and isoproterenol. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of a DMSO assay plate which contained wells containing only DMSO, and (2) three times the standard deviation of these wells. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 15 and active compounds range of activity score is 15 to 100.
