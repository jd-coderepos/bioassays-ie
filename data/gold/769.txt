Dose response biochemical assay for autofluorescent inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) activity This assay is based on ability of MMP-13 to cleave a fluorogenic triple-helical peptide (fTHP), which was modeled after the consensus binding and cleavage site by MMP-13 in type I-III collagens. The fTHP is labeled with both a fluorophore (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (Mca) and a quencher 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) that comprise a fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) pair. Cleavage of the fHTP peptide results in unquenching of the Mca fluorescence. In this assay, the fluorescence signal from liberated Mca fluorescence is directly proportional to MMP-13 activity. This assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5 microliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate (provided by Prof. G.B. Fields, Florida Atlantic University) in Assay Buffer containing 50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% v/v Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2, pH 7.5 (all chemicals purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of test compound or positive or negative control (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The enzymatic reaction was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 2.66 nanomolar MMP-13 in Assay Buffer (same composition as above). Fluorescence (t0) was read after enzyme addition on a Perkin-Elmer Viewlux microplate reader (excitation = 325nm, emission = 450nm). After 4 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence (t4) was read again. The difference between RFU values read at t0 (RFU_t0) and t4 (RFU_t4), named delta RFU, was calculated as follows: delta RFU = RFU_t4 - RFU_t0 The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = (test_compound_delta RFU - negative_control_ delta RFU)/( positive_control_ delta RFU - negative_control_ delta RFU)*100 Where positive_control is defined as test wells containing 8 micromolar MMP13 inhibitor and negative_control is defined as test wells containing DMSO only. For each compound, percentage inhibitions were plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for X-intercept at the 50% inhibition level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 39.8 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 39.8 micromolar. Compounds with IC50 of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 of equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.
