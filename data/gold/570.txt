The assay is based on ability of MMP-13 to cleave fluorogenic triple-helical peptide (fTHP), which was modeled after the consensus binding and cleavage site by MMP-13 in type I-III collagens.  The fTHP is labeled with both a fluorophore (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl (Mca) and quencher 2,4-dinitrophenyl (Dnp) that comprise a fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) pair. Cleavage of the fHTP peptide results in liberation of the fluorescent Mca moiety. In this assay, the fluorescence signal from liberated Mca is directly proportional to MMP-13 activity. The primary HTS campaign was conducted in 1536 well plate format. All compounds were tested once at a 4 micromolar final concentration. This assay used Excitation filter 340 +/- 30 nm, Emission 450 +/- 10 nm Viewlux filter set. 2.5 microliters of substrate solution containing 8 micromolar MMP-13 substrate (provided by Prof. G. Fields, Florida Atlantic University) in assay buffer (50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2) were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. 20 nanoliters of test compound or positive and negative control (2 millimolar MMP-13 inhibitor (EMD Biosciences) and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The enzymatic reaction was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 2.66 nanomolar MMP-13 in assay buffer (50 millimolar Tris HCl, 100 millimolar NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, 10 millimolar CaCl2). After 4 hours of incubation, 5 microliters of 50 millimolar EDTA was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 10 minutes and fluorescence was read on Perkin-Elmer Viewlux for 1 second. Prior to inhibition calculations, basal signal (i.e. signal from wells containing all reagents minus inhibitor) was subtracted from test compound and control well values. To calculate percent inhibition, the test compound well signal was divided by the median signal from the 100 percent inhibition control (i.e. wells containing MMP-13 inhibitor) and multiplied by 100.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibitory compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all wells in the sample field of control plate devoid of test or control compounds, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. This assay was found to be prone to fluorescent artifacts due to short excitation wavelength of the fluorophore (Mca). Compounds that appeared to be fluorescent artifact were labeled as "possible fluorescent artifact" in the data submitted to PubChem. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.
