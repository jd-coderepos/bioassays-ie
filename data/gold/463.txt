Compound cytotoxicity is an important parameter to measure when developing potential human therapeutics. We describe a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign that was designed to measure the metabolic activity of a suspension cell line after challenge & 48 hours of incubation with test compound. For this primary HTS campaign the human T-cell line, Jurkat clone E6.1, was screened against the NIH set of 59,808 diverse compounds. All compounds were tested once at a 4 micromolar final concentration. A luciferase-based cell proliferation/viability assay end point kit was used as the readout for this assay. The kit measures the amount of ATP present in the microtiter plate well. If ATP is not present, the catalytic conversion of luciferin into oxyluciferin is not possible, and no luminescence results. Since metabolically active cells produce ATP, the absence of ATP correlates with the presence of inviable cells. This campaign was run with doxorubicin, an antibiotic used as an anti-cancer drug, as the positive control. In this assay, doxorubicin had a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of approximately 100 nM. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 4 micromolar doxorubicin (i.e. 100% inhibition). The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. A suspension of Jurkat cells (clone E6.1; ATCC Cat# TIB-152, Invitrogen Cat# K1045) in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1mM NEAA, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25mM HEPES, 5mM L Glutamine, and 1x antibiotic was prepared prior to assay. The concentration of cells in the suspension was 1 million/milliliter. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. Then 20nL of test compound or control doxorubicin was added. Plates were lidded and incubated at 37 deg C at 5% CO2 for 48 hrs prior to the addition of 5 microliters / well of Cell-Titer Glow (Promega Corp., Madison Wisconsin). After ten minutes of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the Viewlux Imaging UHTS reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland). Percent inhibition was calculated from the median of the positive control doxorubicin at 4 micromolar final screening concentration.
