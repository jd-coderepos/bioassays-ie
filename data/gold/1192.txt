The biology of S1P receptor subtypes. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for purchased structural analogues of a S1P3 agonist (SID 7967985) identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "S1P3 Agonist Dose-Response Potency Assay" (PubChem AID 439).  In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 agonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by agonist induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity.  BLA activity is measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 agonist will increase well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in 384-well plates using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at a nominal test concentration of 10 micromolar. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2. The next day, 50 nL of test compound in DMSO, DMSO alone, or S1P (1 uM final nominal concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. After 4 hours of incubation, 2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 6 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells.  The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.  Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I590 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ((Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control) / (Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control))*100 Where: Test compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration.  A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline was fitted using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept at the 50% activity level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases where the highest concentration tested (10 uM) did not result in 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as > 10 uM.  Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 10 uM and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 10 uM. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero.  Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero.  Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.
