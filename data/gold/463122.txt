Late-stage fluorescence-based dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 2 (S1P2) counterscreen assay. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether powder samples of compounds identified as active in the assay "Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds" (AID 463107) were nonselective agonists as assayed by activation of S1P2. A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with the human S1P2 receptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA) reporter construct was used to measure S1P2 agonism. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. Stimulation of the S1P2 receptor by agonist increases BLA gene transcription. This increase is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 agonists will activate S1P1 and increase well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 50 uM. Protocol Summary: Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in assay media, which consisted of phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). The assay was initiated by dispensing 10 uL of cell suspension to each test well of a 384 well plate (6,000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate wells were then added 50 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 50 uM, final DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for high control wells) followed directly afterwards by 1 uL of S1P in 2% BSA (final concentration of 370 nM, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control (100% antagonism) were added to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated again at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 2.2 uL of this mixture was then added to each well. After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and fluorescence emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Selected datapoints were not included in the calculations because they were outliers. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm / I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Activation = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO High_Control is defined as wells containing 5 uM S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration. The reported EC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% activation level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 uM) did not result in greater than 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an EC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an EC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency of the compounds with fitted curves, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds.
