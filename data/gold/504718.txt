Counterscreen for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput dose response assay to identify antagonists of the parental CHO cell line. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous assays entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1) (AID 434989), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492963) are nonselective inhibitors of Gq signaling. This assay will determine dose response curves. In this assay, the parental CHO cell line (not transfected with any GPCRs) is used to monitor inhibition of Gq activity by test compound. Cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as Gq antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. These compounds are considered nonselective Gq inhibitors. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 49.8 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay, 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470 - 495 nm excitation and 515 - 575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of ATP in DMSO (EC84 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %_Inhibition = ( 1 -( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO alone (no ATP). For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 49.8 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 49.8 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value < 50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >= 50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-98 and for inactive compounds 82-0.
