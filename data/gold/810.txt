The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a tyrosine kinase involved in growth factor and integrin mediated signal transduction pathways As with the primary and confirmation screens, a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) method to monitor the phosphorylation of a poly Glu-Tyr (poly-GT) substrate by FAK was used to screen for inhibitors. The principle of the assay is similar to other kinase detection systems utilizing TR-FRET, except this method utilizes a FRET acceptor dye which is coupled directly to the substrate. The level of substrate phosphorylation by FAK activity is detected with a specific europium-labeled anti-phospho-peptide antibody (Eu-Ab), which serves as the FRET donor. Upon phosphorylation, the recognition and binding of Eu-Ab to phosphorylated tyrosines of the substrate bring the donor and acceptor dyes into close proximity, allowing FRET to occur. A potential inhibitor of FAK would prevent the proper phosphorylation of the substrate, decreasing the FRET signal. Assay preparation was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters per well of a solution containing 2 nM FAK enzyme in kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Tween, 2 mM DTT, final pH 7.0) into a black 1536-well solid bottom non-treated microtiter plate. Next, 35 nL of test compound from the MLSCN library (final nominal concentration of 7 micromolar, 0.7% final DMSO concentration) or positive and negative control (143 micromolar staurosporine and DMSO, respectively) were then added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 200 nM ULight poly GT (4:1) substrate and 10 micromolar ATP in kinase buffer. After 60 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 5 microliters of 1X LANCE detection buffer supplemented with 20 mM EDTA and 4 nM Eu-W1024-labeled PY20 Ab were added to each well. Plates were then incubated 30 minutes at room temperature.  After excitation at 340 nm, fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (ULight) with the ViewLux microplate reader in TRF mode (PerkinElmer).   To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = (I671nm / I617nm) x 10,000 where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = (1-((Ratio TestCompound # Median_Ratio_HighControl) / (Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl)))*100 Where: TestCompound = Wells containing test compound LowControl = Wells containing DMSO HighControl = Wells containing 1 micromolar staurosporine (corresponding to staurosporine#s IC100). For each compound percent inhibition was plotted against test compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 70 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually. Compounds with IC50 of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive; compounds with IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.
