The 14-3-3 proteins are the prototype for a novel class of protein modules that can recognize phosphoserine/threonine (pS/T)-containing motifs in a variety of signaling proteins. To date, 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to bind more than 200 client proteins. Through these interactions, 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in a wide range of vital regulatory processes, such as Bad-induced apoptosis, Raf-1-mediated cell proliferation, and Cdc25-regulated cell cycle progression. In addition to their participation in diverse physiological processes, 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in a number of clinically important pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. Thus, such studies on the 14-3-3/client-protein interactions may provide tremendous opportunities for therapeutic interventions.  Therefore, chemical tools would allow pharmacological probing of 14-3-3 function under various conditions. To develop small-molecule modulators of 14-3-3 proteins, a highly sensitive fluorescence polarization (FP)-based 14-3-3 assay was designed and optimized. In this assay, the interaction of 14-3-3 with a fluorescently labeled phosphopeptide from Raf-1 was used as a model system.  A simple 1-step "mix-and-measure" method was achieved for analyzing 14-3-3 proteins. This is a solution-based, versatile method that can be used to monitor the binding of 14-3-3 with a variety of client proteins. The 14-3-3 FP assay is highly stable and has achieved a robust performance in a 384-well format with a demonstrated signal-to-noise ratio of above 10 and a Z' factor of above 0.7. Because of its simplicity and high sensitivity, this assay is used for high-throughput screening of 14-3-3 modulators. The recombinant hexaHis-tagged 14-3-3gamma were expressed and purified as previously described. The peptide sequence containing phosphorylated S259 of Raf-1 was synthesized and labeled with 5/6 carboxytetramethylrhodamine. HEPES buffer (10mM, pH 7.4), NaCl (150mM), Tween-20 (0.05%), and DTT (0.5 mM) was used through the screening. The 14-3-3 FP assay was carried out in black 384-well uplates in a total volume of 50uL in each well. 49uL of assay reaction buffer (1uM of His-14-3-3gamma and 2nM of TMR-pS259-Raf peptide in HEPES buffer) were dispensed to 384-well black plate. For each assay plate, column 1, 2 and 23, 24 contain controls: TMRpS259-Raf peptide only (blank) and TMR-pS259-Raf peptide with His-14-3-3gamma (negative control); R18 peptide was added to wells with TMR-pS259-Raf peptide and His-14-3-3gamma and serve as positive control. Then 1ul of test compound (2 mM in DMSO) were added and the final compound concentration is 40uM (2% DMSO). Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hr and the fluorescence polarization value in millipolarization (mP) units was measured with an Analyst HT reader. An excitation filter at 545nm and an emission filter at 610 to 675nm were used with a dichroic mirror of 565 nm. Assay data was analyzed using Cambridgesoft. Percentage of inhibition was calculated by dividing mP (subtracting blank) value from compound wells by the average mP (subtracting blank) from negative controls (His-14-3-3gamma and peptide) in each plate and subtracted from 100. An activity cutoff was set as a percent inhibition greater than 30%.
