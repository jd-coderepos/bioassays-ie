Late-stage assay provider results from the probe development effort to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): luminescence-based cell-based dose response assay to determine cytotoxicity of agonist compounds. The purpose of this assay is to determine cytotoxicity of a powder sample of a compound identified as active in the assay "Late-stage fluorescence dose-response cell-based assay to identify agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4): Synthesized compounds" (AID 463107). In this assay, U-2OS cells are incubated with test compound, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in a 7-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 20 uM. Protocol Summary: This assay was started by dispensing U-2OS cells in McCoy's 5A medium plus 10% FBS, penicillin 100 U/ml and streptomycin 100 ug/ml (20 uL, 4 x 10E3 cells/well) into the wells of a 384-well plate. Eight 1:3 serial dilutions of compound (100 uM in growth media) were made. 5 uL of diluted compound or media were added to wells, giving final compound concentrations of 0-20 uM. The plate was incubated at 37 C in a humidified incubator for 24 hours, then equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes. 25 uL CellTitre-Glo reagent was added to each well, followed by incubation of the plate in the dark for 10 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the Envision plate reader. The % growth inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: % Growth Inhibition = ( MedianRFU_High_Control - RFU_Test_Compound ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing cells in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing cells treated with media only (no compound). Low_Control is defined as wells containing no cells (media only). Percent growth inhibition was plotted against the log of the compound concentration. The CC50 is reported as "> X uM" (where X = the highest concentration tested for which < 50% growth inhibition was observed). PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with a CC50 value of less than 10uM were considered active (cytotoxic). Compounds with a CC50 value greater than 10uM were considered inactive (non-cytotoxic). The PubChem Activity Score range for inactive compounds is 0-0. There are no active compounds.
