The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors transduce signals from a variety of extracellular stimuli and are important mediators of inflammation, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (1, 2).  STATs are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, and G-CSF binding to cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (1-3).  In resting cells STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm.  In response to stimuli, STATs are phosphorylated by the Janus-activated kinases (Jaks), which induces STAT dimerization and nuclear translocation, where STATs bind to specific enhancer elements in target genes (2).  Although structurally similar, the seven STAT family member (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) possess diverse biological roles (2).  For example, STAT1 activation is pro-inflammatory and anti-proliferative, while STAT3 activation is anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic (2).  STAT1 is largely responsible for mediating the effects of IFN-gamma, while STAT3 is predominantly involved in IL-6 signaling (4).  STAT1 induces expression of genes that inhibit the cell cycle, and thus STAT1 is considered to have tumor suppressor properties (5).  Studies show that STAT3 is activated in a majority of breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1, 4, 6). Blocking STAT3 interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using peptide aptamers has been shown to reduce tumor growth (7).  Due to the diverse roles and potent phenotypes associated with STAT signaling, the identification of selective modulators of STAT1 and STAT3 activity may lead to pharmacological tools for cancer, wound healing, and inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 862; 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920). In this assay inhibition of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT3 antagonist will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing well luminescence. The STAT3 antagonist and potentiator confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (100 uM final nominal concentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 0% inhibition).  The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. This IL-6 concentration resulted in approximately 80% STAT3::luciferase reporter activity.  Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
