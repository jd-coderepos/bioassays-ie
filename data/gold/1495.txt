The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on cellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological disorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the protein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with misfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone DnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that inhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their importance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel antibiotics. DnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1&#8722;392), a 13kDa substrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638). It has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of chaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good target for the small organic molecules. In an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the substrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay, using a construct of DnaK corresponding to only the b-domain (residues 393-507), the most promising hit and its analogs were tested to determine their binding affinity to DnaK using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. Materials: 1.  The gene coding for the E. coli DnaK substrate binding (beta) domain (393-507) was amplified with PCR and subcloned into pET21a using the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites. The resulting protein contains 17 extra amino acid residues (MGSSHHHHHHGLVPRGS) at the N-terminus. 2.  The protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography.  3.  DnaK, human Hsp70, DnaJ, and GrpE were purchased from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI). 4.  The model substrate NRLLLTG was synthesized by the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). Protocols: 1)  Titrations were done using a VP-ITC from MicroCal (Northampton, MA). 2)  Full-length DnaK or SBD were used at 100 uM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.5-5% DMSO. 3)  Compounds were used at 1-1.5 mM (10-15x protein concentration) in the same buffer. 4) Compounds were also tested for their ability to affect the binding of the model substrate NRLLLTG.  Full-length DnaK was first titrated with a compound to saturation based on evolved heats.  5) The compound/DnaK(FL) complex was then titrated with model substrate NRLLLTG.  6)  Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software provided by the ITC manufacturer (MicroCal, Northampton, MA).
