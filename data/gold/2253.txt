The PhoP regulon is a major regulator of virulence in Salmonella that also controls the adaptation to Mg2+-limiting environments. The PhoP system enables Salmonella to determine its presence in an intracellular or extracellular environment, and to promote the expression of genes required for survival within or entry into host cells, respectively.  The DNA sequence for the PhoP locus indicates that it is composed of two genes present in an operon, termed phoP and phoQ.  The gene products are members of bacterial two-component transcriptional regulators that respond to environmental stimuli, and regulate the expression of genes involved in virulence and macrophage survival of S. enterica.  During the past year Dr. Harris' group has constructed and evaluated multiple PhoP-activated promoter-reporter fusions and compared these results with the relative abundance of gene transcripts in wild-type serovar Typhi.  They also evaluated PhoP-independent as well as PhoP-repressed promoter-reporter constructs in PhoP-non-inducing verses inducing conditions for each of the promoters.  This allowed for the development of a primary screening and counterscreening assays for PhoP-specific inhibitors which may lead to the identification of novel strategies to inhibit the intracellular persistence of bacterial infection. The inhibition eukaryotic cell culture growth was established using THP1 cells (ATCC Cat. # TIB-202), a Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line. This counter-screening assay for eukaryotic culture growth inhibition was performed after the main confirmatory (dose-response) assay.  This counterscreen assay was cell-based in 384-well plate format and tested the cytotoxicity of compounds only, without the addition of bacteria. This assay was conducted with all 2237 screened in the confirmation and counterscreens.  Compounds were plated in dose response format (in less than 1% DMSO final concentration), followed by the addition of cells.  Cells were grown and incubated with compounds in DMEM/pen/strep/L-glutamine/10% FBS, for 72 hr at 37 degrees C/5% CO2. At the end of the incubation time cells were assayed for viability using Cell Titer GLO (Promega).  Compounds that were considered cytotoxic resulted in a decreased luminescent signal. Compounds that interfere with luciferase will appear as toxic in this screen.
