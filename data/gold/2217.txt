Fluorescence polarization-based biochemical high throughput dose response assay for inhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) interactions with BIM-BH3 peptide. Cancer initialization and survival depends upon evasion of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) machinery that normally kills an unneeded or rogue cell (1). Although an effective mechanism for anti-cancer chemotherapeutics is apoptosis induction, cancer cells develop resistance to the pro-apoptotic proteins activated by these drugs (2). Multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) are two well-characterized lymphoid cancers (3). Bcl-2 is an oncoprotein activated in these lymphomas, and serves to inhibit apoptosis induced by many cytotoxic compounds. Members of the Bcl-2 protein family are regulated by protein-protein interactions, forming homo- and heterodimers (4, 5). One of these proteins, MCL1, is essential for survival of human MM cells (6). MCL1 and other Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xl share Bcl-2's ability to oppose apoptosis, as well as sequence homology in 4 a-helical Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions, BH1-BH4 (3). As a result, these proteins are promising targets for studies on tumor initiation, progression and apoptosis resistance. Research showing that MCL1 opposes cell death (7), is highly expressed in hematopoetic stem cells and is regulated by growth factors (8), and that inhibiting Bcl-2 protein-protein interactions via the crucial BH3 domain is a valid approach to cancer drug development (2, 9, 10), suggest that targeted therapies for MCL1 are needed. The identification of selective inhibitors of MCL1 will provide useful tools for the study of lymphoid tumorigenesis, and elucidate mechanisms for apoptosis induction in resistant cancers. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence polarization-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) interactions with BIM-BH3 peptide" (AID 2057), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence polarization-based biochemical high throughput confirmation assay for inhibitors of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) interactions with BIM-BH3 peptide (AID 2168). This biochemical assay monitors binding of the BH3 domain of the Bcl-2 family member, Bim, to the binding pocket of human MCL1. In this fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay, GST-MCL1 fusion protein is incubated with FITC-BH3-Bim peptides, in the presence of test compounds. Binding of peptide to MCL1 target protein increases the effective molecular mass of the peptide, slowing its rotation and increasing millipolarization (mP) units in the well. As designed, compounds that inhibit MCL1 will prevent binding of Bim peptide to MCL1, and increase the proportion of free to bound peptides, thereby reducing mP in the well. Compounds are tested in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 109 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) containing 9.2 nM GST-MCL1 were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test compound in DMSO, unlabeled Bim-BH3 control peptide (0.770 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 8.0 nanomolar FITC-BH3-Bim peptide in assay buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) into all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC FP filter set and a FITC dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 595nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = ( Test_Compound_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) / ( median_ Positive_Control_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing unlabeled Bim-BH3 peptide. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 109 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 109 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-88, for inactive compounds 87-0.
