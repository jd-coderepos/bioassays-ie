Counterscreen assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based dose response assay for antagonists of the orexin 2 receptor (OX2R; HCRTR2), run by assay provider. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "FRET-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 485270), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF)-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492964) are non-selective due to activation of OX2R. This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that stably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX2R/Hcrtr2 (CHO-OX2R). This receptor signals through phospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of receptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX2R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX2R activation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX2R/Hcrtr2 antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in singlicate using a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 100 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX2R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, , 10 ug/mL Blasticidin. The day of the assay, 15000 cells in 7 uL of 1X Stimulation Buffer were seeded into each well of 384-well low volume plates, spun down at 300 rpm for 1 minute. Plates were then incubated for a couple of hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 until time of Assay. Then, 3.5 uL of test compound (4X concentration) in 1X Stimulation buffer 2%DMSO and antagonist controls were added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 3.5 uL of Orexin-A agonist (4X concentration) in 1X Stimulation Buffer and 0.5% DMSO (EC90 average response were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 3 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Next, 3 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). Plates were read in Perkin Elmer Envision instrument with 665/620 filter set recommended by Cisbio Protocol. The IP-One ratio was calculated by: ( 665_nm / 620_nm * 10,000 ) In this assay, test compounds are wells containing test compound, low controls are wells containing 1X Stimulation buffer and 0.5% DMSO, and high controls are wells containing Agonist Orexin A 5 uM. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration using GraphPad Prism. The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 100 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 100 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-68 and for inactive compounds 63-0.
