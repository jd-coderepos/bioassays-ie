To characterize binding of small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on GPR30, a series of dose-response curves were completed for compounds with suggested GPR30 binding ability in primary screening using a competitive binding approach using whole cells. This assay assesses the affinity of small molecules with unknown GPR30 binding affinity to compete with an Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to GPR30 in permeabilized whole cells expressing GPR30-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist characteristics of molecules that bind GPR30 will be assessed using various secondary assays. The assay is conducted in 96-well PCR plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with GPR30-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer's instructions). Twenty-four hours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 mM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 mM L-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at 1x10^7/mL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. The assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control; column 12 contains positive control (1 microM estrogen). Columns 2-10 contain unknown compounds with one compound per column ranging from 100 microM in row A to 10 picoM in row H in 1-log increments. Column 11 contains a dose-response of estrogen ranging from 10 microM to 1 picoM. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 mM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). Acquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery identifies 96- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population is identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for analysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the basis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and defined as having 100% binding E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells using: %Binding = 100 * Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was computed based on three parameters of the dose-response curves. All curves were fit based on %Binding of E2-Alexa633 with no additional normalization using GraphPad Prism and the Nonlinear regression (curve fit) analysis using a sigmoidal dose-response equation. A score of 0-30 was assigned to each compound based on %Binding at the 10uM point of the dose-response curve, where: 0 =  70% < %Binding 10 = 50 < %Binding < 70% 20 = 30 < %Binding < 50% 30 = %Binding < 30% A score of 0-50 was assigned to each curve based on the IC50 value determined by GraphPad Prism, where: 0 = 10^-5 < IC50 10 = 10^-6 < IC50 < 10^-5 20 = 10^-7 < IC50 < 10^-6 30 = 10^-8 < IC50 < 10^-7 40 = 10^-9 < IC50 < 10^-8 50 = IC50 < 10^-9 A score of 0-20 was assigned to each curve based on the range of the dose-response curve of E2-Alexa633 binding using: RANGE = TOP - BOTTOM values from the Prism curve-fit, where: 0 = RANGE < 30 or RANGE > 100 10 = 30 < RANGE < 50 20 = 50 < RANGE < 100 These three scoring parameters were summed to give a possible PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 100. Compounds were considered "Active" if the total PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY SCORE was 50 or greater, "Non-Active" if the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was between 0 and 50, and "Inconclusive" if a curve fit was unable to be generated. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 3 for "Inconclusive", 2 for "Actives" and 1 for "Non-Actives".
