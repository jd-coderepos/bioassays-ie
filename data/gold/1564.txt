Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1). The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1510), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation Cell-Based Assay to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 4 (S1P4)" (PubChem AID 1524), were nonselective antagonists due to inhibition of S1P1. This assay uses Tango S1P1-bla U2OS cells which express S1P1 (EDG1) linked to a GAL4-VP16 transcription factor via a TEV protease site. The cells also express a beta-arrestin/TEV protease fusion protein and a beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene under the control of a UAS response element. Stimulation of the S1P1 receptor by agonist causes migration of the fusion protein to the GPCR, and through proteolysis liberates GAL4-VP16 from the receptor. The liberated VP16-GAL4 migrates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of the BLA gene. BLA expression is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable, fluorogenic, cell-permeable BLA substrate. As designed, test compounds that act as S1P1 antagonists will inhibit S1P1 activation and migration of the fusion protein, thus preventing proteolysis of GAL4-VP16 and BLA transcription, leading to no increase in well FRET. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar. Protocol Summary: U2OS cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of McCoy#s 5A Medium supplemented with 10% v/v dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin, 200 micrograms/mL Zeocin, 50 micrograms/mL Hygromycin, 100 micrograms/mL Geneticin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 250,000/mL in Assay Medium (Freestyle Expression Medium without supplements). The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well, followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or S1P (10 nM final nominal EC80 concentration) prepared in 2% BSA was added to the appropriate wells. Plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the LiveBLAzer FRET substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 460 nm and 535 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100* (1-(((Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control)/ (Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control))) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed inhibition value. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 24 and active compounds range of activity score is 24 to 100.
