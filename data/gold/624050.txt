Counterscreen assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1): Fluorescence-based cell-based dose response assay for antagonists of the orexin 2 receptor (OX2R; HCRTR2), run by assay provider. Assay Overview: The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1) (AID 434989), and that confirmed activity in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R; HCRTR1)" (AID 492963) are non-selective due to activation of OX2R. In this assay CHO cells stably transfected with the human OX2R receptor (CHO/OX2R cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the Calcium5 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as OX2R antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate using in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 88.8 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO/OX2R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 10 ug/mL Blasticidin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and Amphotericin B). The day before the assay 10,000 cells in 25 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 384 well PDL coated black plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for ~15 hours. Next, media was gently removed (by tapping plate on absorbent tissue) and exchanged with HBSS-20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 @ RT), 2.5 mM Probenecid, 0.5% DMSO at 2 5uL/well. 25 uL of the Calcium5, 1X dye (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes in dark @ room temperature. 6.25 uL of antagonist (in assay buffer: HBSS-20mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenecid, 4.5% DMSO) was added and incubated for another 30 minutes in dark at room temperature. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (665 nm/620 nm) for 10 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 6.25 uL of Orexin-A agonist in HBSS-20mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenecid, 0.5% DMSO, were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 60 seconds of the assay. In this assay, test compounds are wells containing test compound, low controls are wells containing Orexin A peptide Challenge (50 nM) + 10 uM Antagonist, and high controls are wells containing the Orexin A peptide at 50 nM. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration using GraphPad Prism. The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 88.8 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 88.8 uM. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-89 and for inactive compounds 89-0.
