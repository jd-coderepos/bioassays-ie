Dose Response Cell Based Assay for Antagonists of the S1P2 Receptor A cell line expressing both the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter and the human S1P2 receptor was used to identify compounds that inhibit S1P2 activity. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and the cells express low BLA levels. Treatment of the cells with an S1P agonist stimulates the S1P2 receptor and activates BLA gene transcription. An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents activation by S1P, and as a result decreases transcription of the BLA gene. This decrease is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for 61 available of 64 compounds that had greater than 50 percent inhibition and passed hit selection criteria from a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)" (PubChem AID = 736). Dose response curves were subsequently determined for a set of 22 purchased compounds structurally similar to the hit compound (SID 14730083, SID 46371185) identified in a set of experiments entitled "Dose Response Cell Based Assay for Antagonists of the S1P2 Receptor" (PubChem AID = 851, this experiment) and "Counterscreen for S1P2 Antagonists: Dose Response Cell-Based Screen to Identify Antagonists of CRE-BLA" (PubChem AID =856).   A Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with both the S1P2 receptor and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) reporter construct was used. Cells were cultured 37 degrees C and 95 percent relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10 percent v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL geneticin, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 percent charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum.  Next, 10 ul(100,000 cells/well) of cell suspension was dispensed into each well of the assay plates and incubate in the plates for 20 hrs at 37 degrees C, 5 percent CO2 and 95 percent RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 50 nl of test compound in DMSO, DMSO (negative control wells) or JTE-013 (final nominal concentration 3 uM, positive control wells) to the appropriate wells.  Immediately after this dispense, 1 ul of S1P in 2 percent BSA (final concentration of 750 nM, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80 percent activity) was dispensed into negative control wells and test compound wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5 percent CO2 for 4 hours. After the incubation, 2.2 ul of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol including 15 mM probenecid) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio (I460nm/I590nm) where I is defined as the measured fluorescence emission at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers as follows: Percent Inhibition= (1-((test_compound - median_positive_control)/ (median_negative_control - median_positive_control)))*100 Where: Test compound is defined as wells containing test compound and 750nM S1P Positive control is defined as wells containing 3 uM JTE-013 alone (100 percent inhibition) Negative control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 750 nM S1P (0 percent inhibition) For each compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50 percent activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (42 uM) did not result in > 50 percent inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 uM were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 uM are considered active. The activity score was calculated from pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and is based on the observed pIC50 range.  Specifically, the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50 percent inhibition is observed. This calculation resulted in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested.
