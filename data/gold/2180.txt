The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics. Cell line creation and culture of the human mGluR4/ Gqi5/CHO line. Human mGluR4 (hmGluR4)/CHO cells were stably transfected with the chimeric G protein Gqi5 in pIRESneo3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and single neomycin-resistant clones were isolated and screened for mGluR4-mediated calcium mobilization using the method described below. hmGluR4/CHO cells were cultured in 90 percent Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM), 10 percent dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 20 ug/ml proline, 2 mM glutamine, 400 ug/ml G418 sufate (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and 5 nM methotrexate (Calbiochem, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise noted. Fold shift determinations. Assays were performed within Vanderbilt University's High-Throughput Screening Center. Human mGluR4/CHO cells (30,000 cells/20 ul/well) were plated in black-walled, clear-bottomed, TC treated, 384 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, North Carolina) in DMEM containing 10 percent dialyzed FBS, 20 mM HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Plating Medium). The cells were grown overnight at 37 degrees C in the presence of 5 percent CO2.  The next day, the medium was removed and replaced with 20 uL of 1 uM Fluo-4, AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prepared as a 2.3 mM stock in DMSO and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 10 percent (w/v) pluronic acid F-127 and diluted in Assay Buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM Probenecid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)) for 45 minutes at 37 degrees C.  Dye was removed and replaced with 20 uL of Assay Buffer. Test compounds were transferred to daughter plates using an Echo acoustic plate reformatter (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) and then diluted into Assay Buffer to generate a 20 uM stock. Ca2+ flux was measured using the Functional Drug Screening System 6000 (FDSS6000, Hamamatsu, Japan). Baseline readings were taken (10 images at 1 Hz, excitation, 47+/-20 nm, emission, 540+/-30 nm) and then 20 ul/well test compounds were added using the FDSS's integrated pipettor. Cells were incubated with test compounds (final concentration 30 uM) for 2.5 minutes and then increasing concentrations of glutamate were applied. FDSS data were analyzed using a custom analysis application. For fold shift experiments, 20 ul of test compound (2X concentration, 30 uM final concentration) was applied approximately 2.5 minutes prior to increasing concentrations of glutamate (10 ul of a 5x final concentration). Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). Subsequent confirmations of concentration-response parameters were performed using independent serial dilutions of source compounds and data from multiple days experiments were integrated and fit using a four point logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For compounds that changed the EC50 of glutamate 3 fold or less, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inactive' and 'Score' was assigned as '1'. For compounds that changed the EC50 of glutamate greater than 3 fold, 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Active'. 'Score' was assigned as '50' for those with a fold-shift less than or equal to 10 or as '100' for those with a fold-shift greater than 10.
