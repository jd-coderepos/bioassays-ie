Primary Cell-Based High-Throughput Screening to Identify Antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2) A cell line expressing both the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter and the human S1P2 receptor was used to measure S1P2 antagonism. Under normal conditions, S1P2 has low basal activity and therefore cells express low BLA levels. In this assay, cells have been stimulated with the S1P agonist, which stimulates the S1P2 receptor, hence increasing BLA gene transcription. An antagonist is identified as a compound that prevents activation by exogenously added S1P. Therefore, in the presence of a potential S1P2 antagonist, transcription of the BLA gene will decrease. This decrease is monitored by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a cleavable fluorogenic cell permeable BLA substrate. In this assay, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with the human S1P2 receptor and a cAMP Response Element-beta lactamase (CRE-BLA) reporter construct was used. Cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks (Corning, part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 10% v/v heat inactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in assay media, which consisted of phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media supplemented with 2% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (mix of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin). The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate (5000 cells/well) followed by incubation at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 16 hrs. To the appropriate wells were then added 26 nL of test compound in DMSO (final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar, final DMSO concentration of 0.5%) or DMSO only (for high control wells) followed directly afterwards by 1 microliter of S1P in 2% BSA (final concentration of 750 nanomolar, i.e. a concentration that resulted in 80% activity). The high control (EC80 challenge) and low control (100% antagonism) were added to the appropriate control wells and plates were incubated again at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 2 hrs. The fluorogenic LiveBLAzer substrate mixture with 10 mM Probenicid was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and 1 microliter of this mixture was then added to each well. After a further 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and fluorescence emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting "background" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media and substrate only. To normalize assay data, values measured from both the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I535 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %Inhibition= ((Ratio_Test_Compound-Median_Ratio_High_Control)/(Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))*100 Where: Low Control: test wells containing 750 nanomolar of S1P and 3.1 micromolar JTE-013, corresponding to 100% antagonism High Control: test wells containing 750 nanomolar of S1P, corresponding to its EC80 A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared as an inhibitor. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.
