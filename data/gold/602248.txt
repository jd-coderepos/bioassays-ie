Full deck counterscreen for agonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1): Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify nonselective activators and assay artifacts using the parental CHOK1 cell line. The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that non-selectively modulate endogenous CHO-K1 cell GPCRs or that interfere with the assay format or calcium signaling. This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1)" (AID 588814). This assay uses ATP as the agonist. In this assay parental CHO-K1 cells are loaded with the Fluo-8 fluorogenic calcium indicator dye for 60 min at 37 C, followed by addition of test compounds. As designed, a compound that non-selectively increases calcium signaling or is an assay artifact will lead to increased fluorescence intensity of the dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin). The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: %_Activation = ( (Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing ATP (EC100) and DMSO. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in this full deck counterscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, and for inactive compounds 1-0.
