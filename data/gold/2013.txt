The cannabinoid and endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of drug dependence and addiction disorders.  GPR55, an orphan G-Protein Coupled Receptor, has been reported to be a cannabinoid receptor, but its status as such remains unresolved due to conflicting results from pharmacological studies.  The goal of this project is to identify small molecule antagonists of GPR55, which may aid in the deorphanization efforts of this receptor and ultimately further the understanding of the role of GPR55 in drug addiction. This high content imaging assay utilizes a cell line permanently expressing a beta-arrestin GFP biosensor and an enhanced GPR55 receptor.  Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane to coated pits and further into endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins. The GPR55 antagonistic action of a compound in the presence of the GPR55 agonist Lysophosphatidylinositol will be detected as a decrease in local aggregation of the GFP arrestins Assay Materials: 1) 384-well plates, black with clear bottom (Greiner# 781091) 2) U2OS (Human Osteosarcoma) cell line stably expressing the Beta-arrestin GFP and GPR55 receptor 3) Culture Media: MEM with L-glutamine, Pen-strep, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and selection antibiotics - 100ug/ml G418 and 50ug/ml Zeocin 4) Agonist Working Solution: Lysophosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar #850090P, 5mM stock in DMSO) diluted to 50uM in water.  5) Controls Working Solution: 2.5% DMSO diluted in water (for positive control wells: no agonist will be added to mimic 100% inhibition of agonist-mediated response; for negative control wells: LPI agonist will be added to mimic 0% inhibition of agonist-mediated response). 6) Fixative Working Solution: 6% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. 7) Nuclear Stain Working Solution: DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306) diluted to 150ng/ml in DAPI buffer (10mM TRIS, 10mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Primary Screen Procedure: 1) 45ul of cell suspension (200,000 cells/ml in culture medium) was dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a Wellmate bulk dispenser.  2) Plates are incubated overnight or approximately 20 hours at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. 3) Serum is removed by media aspiration and replacing with 45ul serum-free MEM prior to addition of compounds. 4) Compound addition was done on a Biomek FX with 384-head dispenser (Beckman): a) 5ul of 100uM compound solution was added to columns 3 through 24 of the assay plates for a final assay compound concentration of 10uM and 0.25% DMSO.  b) 5ul of control (2.5% DMSO) working solution was added to column 1 and 2 for a final concentration of 0.25% DMSO. c) Plates were pre-incubated with compound for 30 minutes at 37 degree C and 5% CO2 prior to addition of LPI. d) After 30-minutes, 5ul of the agonist (50uM LPI) working solution was added to entire plate except column 1 for a final compound concentration of 5uM (~EC80). 5) Plates were incubated for 75 minutes at 37C and 5% CO2.  6) Media was aspirated leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer.  7) 40ul of fixative working solution was added to each well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Matrix) for a final concentration of 4% PFA. 8) Plates were incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. 9) Fixative was aspirated and plates were washed twice with 50ul PBS leaving 20ul liquid in each well using a Titertek plate washer. 10) 40ul of DAPI working solution was added using a Wellmate bulk dispenser for a final DAPI concentration of 100ng/ml. Aluminum plate sealers were applied to each plate. Hit Confirmation Procedure: A. Single-concentration Confirmation  1)Same as primary screen, except compound addition was done using the ECHO55 Acoustic Dispenser. B. Dose Response Confirmation 1) Same as  primary screen steps 1 to 3. 2) Compound addition was done on the ECHO550 Acoustic Dispenser.  The "dose response protocol" was used to dispense corresponding volumes of each 10mM compound on the assay plate. a. Compounds were added to columns 3 to 22. Final concentration ranged from 32uM to 500nM (seven doses), performed in duplicate and on 2 different days. b. For control wells, 160nL of 100% DMSO was added to columns 1 and 2 for a final DMSO concentration of 0.31%.  c. Plates were pre-incubated with compound for 30 minutes at 37 degree C and 5% CO2 prior to addition of LPI. d. After 30-minutes, 5ul of the agonist working solution was added to entire plate except column 1 using the Biomek FX . Final LPI concentration was 5uM. 3) Primary screen procedure steps 5 to 10 were followed.  Image Acquisition and Analysis: 1) Image acquisition was performed on an Opera QEHS (Perkin Elmer) with 45 plate capacity loader/stacker and the following settings:    - 20x 0.45 NA air objective    - Acquisition camera set to 2-by-2 binning for an image size of 688 by 512 pixels    - 2 channels acquired sequentially: Exp1Cam1 = Beta-arrestin GFP using 488 nm laser excitation and 540/70 nm emisssion filters, Exp2Cam2 = DAPI (nuclei) using 365 nm Xenon lamp excitation and 450/50 nm emission filters    - 2 fields per well for Primary screen    - 4 fields per well for Hit Confirmation 2) Image analysis was performed using the Acapella Spot Detection Algorithm with the following analysis settings: NUCLEI DETECTION   - Threshold Adjustment:    1.5   - Nuclear Splitting Adjustment:   7 - Minimum Nuclear Area:   70   - Minimum Nuclear Contrast:   0.1 CYTOPLASM DETECTION   - Cytoplasm Threshold Adjustment:  0.45   - Cytoplasm Individual Threshold Adjust.: 0.15 SPOT DETECTION         - Spot Minimum Distance:   3       - Spot Peak Radius:    0       - Spot Reference Radius:   2       - Spot Minimum Contrast:   0.25 - Spot Minimum to Cell Intensity:  1 3) Metrics calculated from... NUCLEI IMAGES: Cell Count ("NumberofCellsAnalyzed"), Nuclei Area ("AreaoftheNucleus"), Integrated Intensity of the Nuclei ("TotalIntegratedIntensityoftheNucleus"), Average Intensity of the Nuclei ("AverageIntensityoftheNucleus"); GFP IMAGES: Integrated Intensity of the Cytoplasm ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity"), Integrated Intensity of the Detected Spots ("TotalSpotIntensity"), Ratio of the Integrated Spot to Integrated Cytoplasm Intensities ("RatioofSpotIntensitytoCytoplasmintensity"), Number of Spots per Cell ("AverageSpotsPerCell"), Percentage of Cells Positive for Spot Formation ("PercentagePositiveCells") 4)  Actives from the primary screen were determined using CBIS software (ChemInnovations) by calculating the %activation of the "AverageSpotsPerCells" metric and using a hit criteria of Activity > 60% and "Number of Cells Analyzed" >100 and "TotalCytoplasmIntensity" < 500,000.  Wells with cell counts lower than 100 in the 2 acquired images were flagged "cytotoxic / low cell count". Wells with a very high total GFP intensity ("TotalCytoplasmIntensity" > 500,000) were flagged artifacts due to autofluorescence. All flagged wells were excluded from hit selection.
