The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932), and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (AID 1262). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 932 and AID 1262; 2) they were declared inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (AID 871); 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT1 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure NF-kappaB activation" (AID 1306); and 4) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for STAT1 activators: cell-based high throughput assay to measure STAT3 activation" (AID 1316). In this assay STAT1 activation was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a STAT1::luciferase construct.  Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compound, followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 activator will increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus increasing transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, leading to increased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series, starting at a nominal test concentration of 55.7 micromolar. The activator and inhibitor dose response assays using STAT1::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 micrograms/ml of neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Then, 1 ul of human recombinant IFN-gamma (3.0 ng/mL final nominal EC80 concentration, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to all wells. The plates were next incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
