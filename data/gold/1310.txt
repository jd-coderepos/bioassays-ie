The purpose of this assay is to determine whether a subset of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 inhibition" (PubChem AID 920), were nonselective inhibitors due to inhibition of STAT3. The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 920; and 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 inhibition" (PubChem AID 862). In this assay inhibition of STAT3 transcription was measured using a human U3A fibrosarcoma cell line that stably expresses a human STAT3::luciferase construct. This cell line is deficient in STAT1. Test compounds were screened for their ability to prevent or reduce IL-6-mediated STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compounds, followed by treatment with IL-6 to activate STAT3 transcription. Changes in STAT3::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. An inhibitor will block IL-6-mediated STAT3 transcription, thus preventing or reducing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and decreasing well luminescence. As designed, test compounds that inhibit STAT3 activity are considered non-selective inhibitors. Compounds were tested in triplicate. The inhibitor and activator counterscreen assays using STAT3::luciferase cells were run simultaneously. U3A cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 100 micrograms/mL neomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay the cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter. Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 uM final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, while High Control wells received nifuroxazide (100 uM final nominal concentration; set as 100% inhibition) in DMSO, and Low Control wells received DMSO (0.6% final concentration; set as 0% inhibition). The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). Next, 1 ul of human recombinant IL-6 (33 ng/ml final concentration) was dispensed into sample and all control wells. This IL-6 concentration resulted in approximately 80% STAT3::luciferase reporter activity. Next, plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
