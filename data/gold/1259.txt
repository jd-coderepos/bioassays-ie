The human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family is evolutionarily conserved among all organisms from archaebacteria to humans, suggesting an essential role in cell survival (1, 2). Under circumstances of transient cell stress, the heat shock response and activities of molecular chaperones can restore protein homeostasis. In human disease, however, misfolded proteins can accumulate when polyglutamine-expansion proteins are chronically expressed over the life of the cell. Elevated expression of molecular chaperones suppresses protein misfolding/aggregation and toxicity phenotypes in various model systems of Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the respective proteins huntingtin, tau, alpha-synuclein, and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), associated with these diseases, result in the appearance of misfolded species that adopt alternate conformations. These observations led to the proposal that a common feature of diverse diseases of protein conformation is the appearance of alternate folded states that self-associate and form toxic species and protein aggregates. A role for Hsp70 family proteins in controlling these events has been widely studied. Studies with mammalian tissue culture cells, transgenic mice, Drosophila, and C. elegans have established that the heat shock response can be activated in cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins, suggesting a role for molecular chaperones as an adaptive survival response (3, 4). Moreover, a direct relationship with polyglutamine diseases is suggested by the co-localization of several heat shock proteins, including Hdj-1, Hdj-2, Hsp70 and ubiquitin with polyglutamine aggregates in the tissues of affected individuals, transgenic mice and tissue culture cells (5). Finally, overexpression of Hsp70 can suppress the toxicity associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins (6-8). High throughput screening initiatives aimed at the identification of compounds that enhance the heat shock response, in particular Hsp70, will provide insights into this conserved cellular process and may lead to novel therapeutics for these devastating disorders. The purpose of this assay is to determine the cytotoxicity of test compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)" (PubChem AID 1203) and confirmed activity via dose-response assays entitled, "Dose response cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify transcriptional activators of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)" (PubChem AID 1252).  The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent to measure intracellular ATP found in viable cells.  Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of ATP. Thus, well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability.  As designed, compounds that induce cell death will reduce ATP levels, and therefore reduce well luminescence.  Compounds were assayed in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 99 uM.  Compounds active in the assays above and inactive in this cytotoxicity counterscreen are considered nontoxic inducers of Hsp70 transcription.
