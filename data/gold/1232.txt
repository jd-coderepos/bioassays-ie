Dose Response Cell-Based Assay for Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 2 (S1P2): Purchased Analogues. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat-inactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.0 million/mL in DMEM as above, except without phenol red and antibiotics, and containing 0.5 % charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Next, 10 microliters of cell suspension (10,000 cells) were dispensed into each well and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5 % CO2.  The assay was started by dispensing 50 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone to sample or negative control wells, respectively. Next, 1.1 microliters of S1P (1 micromolar final nominal concentration) in 2 % fatty acid-free BSA were dispensed to positive control wells. Then, 1.1 microliters of 2 % fatty acid-free BSA was dispensed to negative control and test compound wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 degrees C in 5 % CO2 for 4 hours. Next, 2.2 microliters/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid, was added.  After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. Values from each channel were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/I590 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength Percent activation was then calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = 100 *(Ratio_Test_Compound # Median_Ratio_Negative_Control) / (Median_Ratio_Positive_Control # Median_Ratio_Negative_Control) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Negative_Control is defined as wells containing BSA Positive_Control is defined as wells containing S1P For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration.  A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline was fitted using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept at the 50% activity level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases where the highest concentration tested (10 micromolar) did not result in 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as > 10 micromolar.  Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive.  Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 10 micromolar and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 10 micromolar. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero.  Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero.  Activity score was then ranked by potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.
