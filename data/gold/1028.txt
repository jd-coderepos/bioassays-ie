The activity of DPM-DC was measured fluorometrically by coupling the formation of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of ADP formation was quantitated by the reduction of fluorescence (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) due to the oxidation of NADH to NAD by lactate dehydrogenase. A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that auto fluoresce under these conditions. A total of 76 compounds were initially screened at a final concentration of 50 uM. Compounds with more than 20% inhibition at 50 uM were then tested in dose response assays at eight concentrations, ranging from 100 uM to 0.625 uM depending on the % inhibition for each compound in the initial 50 uM screen. To confirm that the compounds were specifically inhibiting DPM-DC and not one of the other enzymes in the assay, the compounds were tested in parallel in an assay that contained hexokinase as the enzyme instead of DPM-DC and glucose as the substrate instead of diphosphomevalonate.  None of the compounds tested inhibited in this "coupling enzymes" assay. Diphosphomevalonate Decarboxylase Protocol for 0.5 mL Fluorescence Cuvet Assay Purified recombinant DPM-DC enzyme was provided by Dr. Thomas Leyh, Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. 236 uL of DPM-DC reagent mix which included NADH, diphosphomevalonate, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, MgCl2, KCl, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase in buffer was added to each 0.5 mL fluorescence cuvet. Compounds were then added to the cuvets in 4 uL volumes in DMSO. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 160 uL of DPM-DC, diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 0.02 mM NADH, 0.005 mM diphosphomelalonate, 4 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.4 mM ATP, 2 mM potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 units/mL each of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, 1% DMSO, and 30 nM DPM-DC enzyme diluted in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8) in a final volume of 400 uL. The cuvets were immediately transferred to an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (excitation wavelength = 339 nm, emission wavelength = 460 nm) and reduction in fluorescence was measured for 3 minutes. Each compound was tested in triplicate for the initial 50 uM screen and for the dose response assays each concentration was in triplicate.  Full reaction controls were assays with 4 uL of DMSO added instead of compound.  Background controls were assays in which 160 uL of assay buffer was added instead of DPM-DC.  The 'coupling enzyme' assays were performed as above by replacing DPM-DC with hexokinase and diphosphomevalonate with glucose.
