To identify small molecules that mediate calcium signaling via GPR30, a fluorescence-based calcium assay using whole cells was employed to screen a small library of compounds selected by virtual screening on the basis of structural similarity to a compound identified in previous competition binding assays using GPR30 (SID 48409542). This assay was also employed as a counter-screen for compounds identified in competition binding assays with ERalpha and ERbeta to assess ligand selectivity. HL-60 cells (ATCC #CCL-240) expressing endogenous GPR30 were grown in RPMI media containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep and 2 milliM glutamine. Forty-eight hours prior to assay, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in phenol-red free RPMI containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS. Cells were harvested and resuspended in phenol-red free RPMI at a density of 1x10^7 cells / milliL. Cells were loaded 3 microM Indo-1AM (Invitrogen) in DMSO containing 0.05% pleuronic-F127 and nutated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS and resuspended at a final concentration of 1x10^5 cells / microL and incubated on ice for 20 minutes prior to assay. The assay was conducted in a Photon Technology International fluorimeter equipped with two PMTs. Cells loaded with Indo-1AM were excited with 350nm light and emission was collected at 405nm and 490nm. Cuvettes were constantly stirred during data acquisition and maintained at 37 degreesC for the duration of the assay. Each 1 centiM square cuvette was loaded with 20 microL cells (2x10^6 cells) and 980 microL warm Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (pH 6.7) containing 20 milliM HEPES, 1 milliM calcium and 1 milliM magnesium. Cuvettes were incubated in the instrument for 90 seconds prior to data acquisition. Unknown compounds were injected in real time via a sample port at time = 20 seconds to determine agonist activity of the unknown compound. A concentration of estrogen known to induce a sub-maximal calcium flux signal was injected into the cuvette 90 seconds following addition of unknown compound to determine if the compound being screened antagonized estrogen-mediated calcium signaling. Concentration of test compound was 10 microM. The AGONIST_RESPONSE was determined based on the ability of the compounds to mobilize calcium or to prevent calcium mobilization in response to a known agonist. Based on estrogen mediated calcium mobilization = 100%, scores were assigned as follows for compounds with agonist activity: 0 = No calcium mobilization or low mobilization (0-50%) 50 = Moderate calcium mobilization, 50% - 100% 100 = High calcium mobilization, 100% or more Compounds with antagonist activity were assigned scores based on their ability to inhibit calcium mobilization (shown in column entitled ANTAGONIST_RESPONSE), with estrogen control defined as 0% inhibition: 0 = No inhibition of calcium mobilization or low inhibition (0-30%) 50 = Moderate calcium inhibion, 30 # 60% 100 = High calcium inhibition, 60% or more PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the maximum value of either AGONIST_RESPONSE or ANTAGONIST_RESPONSE. In column PUBCHEM_ASSAYDATA_COMMENT the type of response observed was noted. Compounds were classified as "Actives" when PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 and were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of "2".  "Non-active" compounds were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of "1". A number of compounds were designated as fluorescent compounds and given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME of "3". The criteria used for this designation was based on the fluorescence of compound in testing cuvette being greater than observed with triton addition (i.e., greatest calcium mobilization).
