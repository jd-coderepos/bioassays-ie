Compounds identified from a previously described set of experiments entitled "S1P3 Agonist Primary HTS and Confirmation Assays" were selected for testing in this assay. Further information on the previous set of experiments can be found by searching on this website for PubChem AID = 373.  A cell line containing the human S1P3 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 agonism. If the S1P3 receptor was stimulated by agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. In this experiment, 69 compounds that passed hit selection criteria were tested to determine individual EC50 values. The compounds were "hit-picked" at a 10 millimolar in DMSO and further serially diluted nine times at three fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound concentrations. The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. S1P was used as the positive control. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar S1P (i.e. 100% activation). In this assay, S1P had a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of approximately 200 nM. Dose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (45 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition, the EC50 was determined manually as > 45 micromolar. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 45 micromolar and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 45 micromolar. The assay began by dispensing 5 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 deg C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 25 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. The S1P positive control was also added to the appropriate control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer's fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.
