With over 30 million people infected worldwide, and an estimated 2.5 million new infections and 2.1 million AIDS-related deaths occurring each year, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has a significant public health and socioeconomic impact throughout the world.  Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent HIV-1 infection, and although numerous antiretroviral drugs have been approved by the FDA, development of drug resistance to these drugs remains a significant problem for the treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals.  The fusion of HIV-1 with the cellular membrane during entry of the virus into a cell is an established target for inhibition of HIV-1 infection, however only one drug (Fuzeon/enfuvirtide/T20) is currently FDA-approved, and no small molecule inhibitors of this target are available.  Hence, this program will provide chemical probes from which to optimize leads for the development of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. The CCR5 Tropic HIV-1 Fusion Inhibition Assay (PMID 16314403 and 18316528) uses two different cell lines to detect HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion. The first cell line (MAGI-CCR5 cells; (PMID 9094670); obtained from the NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program) has been engineered to express the HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) proteins, and to contain an HIV-1 LTR-beta-galactosidase reporter construct.  The second cell line (HeLa-R5-16; (PMID 16314403); obtained as a kind gift from Roche Palo Alto, LLC) has been engineered to express the Envelope protein (Env) from the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 clinical isolate 92US715, and also to express the Tat protein from HIV-1 NL4 3.  Expression of CCR5-tropic Env in the HeLa-R5-16 cells is induced from the Tet On promoter through treatment with Doxycycline, while Tat is constitutively expressed by the cells.  Co culturing of the two cell lines leads to HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion, thereby introducing HIV-1 Tat from the HeLa-R5-16 cells into the MAGI-CCR5 cells, which results in Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR-beta-galactosidase reporter construct and upregulation of beta galactosidase expression.  As a result, beta galactosidase activity, which is measured as a luminescent signal, serves as a reporter for monitoring HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and its inhibition.  In the absence of an inhibitor, co-cultures of the two cell lines exhibit a high basal level of beta galactosidase activity. Compounds that inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion prevent the upregulation of beta galactosidase expression, resulting in a low luminescent signal.  This assay identifies compounds that inhibit the viral attachment, fusion, and related events associated with HIV-1 entry into a cell. Materials: 384-well plate (Corning, catalog number 3712), Beta-Glo Luciferase (Promega), Doxycycline hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals), Maraviroc, and DMEM (Cellgro cat. 10-013-CV) Cell Culture:  The two cell lines used were MAGI-CCR5 cells (engineered to express the HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) proteins, and containing an HIV-1 LTR-beta-galactosidase reporter construct) and HeLa-R5-16 cells (engineered to express the Envelope protein from the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 clinical isolate 92US715, and the Tat protein from HIV-1 NL4 3). The HeLa R5-16 effector cells were sub-cultured in DMEM (Cellgro cat. 10-013-CV) with 10% FBS, 100 ug/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin, 2 mM Glutamine, 1X NEAA (Non-essential amino acids) and 500 ug/mL G418 (complete growth medium), while the MAGI-CCR5 target cells were sub-cultured in complete growth medium containing 1 ug/mL Puromycin. The cells were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide, and maintained at sub-confluent density for no more than 20 passages. Compound Dosing/Plating:  Carrier or Maraviroc diluted in complete growth medium containing 1 ug/mL Doxycycline (assay medium) to prepare a 5X concentrated dosing solution (200 nM Maraviroc/5% DMSO) was dispensed into 384-well black clear-bottom tissue culture treated plates (5 uL volume) with a Biomek FX [After cell addition, this should result in a final culture volume in assay plates of 25 uL, with final concentrations of 40 nM Maraviroc and 1% DMSO]. Test compounds were serially diluted in a plate-to-plate matrix or "stacked plate" dose response format.  All 320 compounds in a source plate were diluted together through the 10-plate matrix resulting in a 10-point dose response dilution series. It can be visualized as a serial dilution series proceeding vertically through a stack of plates with the high dose plate on top and the low dose plate on the bottom with the final compound concentration ranging from 0.098 to 50 uM and a final DMSO concentration of 1% for all concentrations. Cell Plating:  On ice and while stirring, MAGI CCR5 (500,000 cells/mL) and HeLa-R5-16 (300,000 cells/mL) cells were mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio and 20 uL of the mixture of the two cell lines dispensed to get 5000 MAGI and 3000 HeLa cells per well. Plates were incubated at 37oC in 5% CO2 for at least 40 h (40-48 h). Endpoint/Detection: At the end of the treatment period, 25 uL of Beta-Glo reagent was added and assay plates incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, in the dark. Luminescence (0.1 second integration time) was read on a PerkinElmer EnVision multilabel plate reader. Data Analysis: Thirty-two control wells containing cells treated with DMSO vehicle and 24 wells containing Maraviroc were included on each assay plate to calculate Z value for each plate and to normalize the data on a per plate basis. Z values ranged from 0.72 to 0.80 with a mean of 0.76. Compound data was normalized and reported as % Inhibition which was calculated using the following formula: % Inhibition = 100*(1-(Cmpd Lum-Med pos Ctrl)/(Med Neg Ctrl-Med Pos Ctrl)). The normalized % Inhibition was plotted against the tested concentrations of 0.098 to 50 uM. The IC50 values were calculated using XLfit formula 205, a 4 parameter Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm allowing extrapolation to identify weakly active compounds.
