To identify small molecules that compete for binding with estrogen on GPR30, a competitive binding approach using whole cells was employed to screen a small library of compounds selected by virtual screening and derived from the MLSMR as well as other in-house chemical libraries. This assay measures the ability of small molecules with unknown GPR30 binding affinity to compete with an Alexa633-conjugated estrogen derivative for binding to GPR30 in permeabilized whole cells expressing GPR30-GFP. Assessment of the agonist or antagonist characteristics of molecules that bind GPR30 will be assessed using various secondary assays. The assay is conducted in 96-well PCR plates with an assay volume of 20 microL. 2x10^6 Cos7 cells (ATCC #CRL-1651) are seeded in 100mm tissue culture plates and transfected with GRP30-GFP using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen; per manufacturer#s instructrions). Twenty-four hours following transfection, media is changed from DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine to serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12 supplemented with Pen/Strep 2 milliM L-glutamine and cells are grown an additional 24 hours. Cells are harvested via mechanical scraping and resuspended at 1x10^7/milliL in serum-free, phenol-red free DMEM F-12. The assay is conducted as follows. Column 1 contains cells with vehicle control; column 12 contains positive control (1 microM estrogen). Columns 2-11 contain unknown compounds. Immediately prior to assay, compounds in DMSO are diluted 1:50 in ligand dilution buffer (10 milliM HEPES pH7.6, 0.1% BSA in dH20). Wells containing 9 microL of cells (approximately 90,000 cells) and 1 microL of compound are incubated 10 minutes at 37 degreesC. Following incubation, 10 microL of permeabilization buffer (5 milliM EGTA, 100 milliM NaCl, 1 milliM MgCl(2), 80mM PIPES [Piperazine-N-N-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid]-KOH, in dH2O, pH 6.8) containing 20 nanoM E2-Alexa633 and 0.05% saponin is added to each well, mixed, and the plate is incubated 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Wells are then washed with 100 microL PBS containing 2% BSA, pelleted, and resuspended in 25 microL PBS +2% BSA. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry system and a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako). Forward scatter, side scatter and GFP fluorescence (FL-1) are collected using a 488nM laser, while E2-Alexa633 fluorescence is collected using a 633nM laser (FL-8). Primary screening was completed at 10 microM. Acquired data were analyzed using IDLQuery software, developed by Bruce Edwards. IDLQuery identifies 96- discrete data sets, each corresponding to a single sample well. The cell population is identified based on forward and side scatter parameters and transfected cells are gated on for analysis on the basis of GFP expression. Each well is analyzed for E2-Alexa633 fluorescence on the basis of mean channel fluorescence. The vehicle control wells are pooled from each plate and defined as having 0% inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding and the positive control (estrogen) wells are pooled from each plate and defined as inhibiting 100% of specific E2-Alexa633 binding. Sample wells are assigned a value based on their E2-Alexa633 fluorescence relative to control wells. Compounds were considered "Active" if they inhibited more than 60% of binding at 10 microM. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME is indicated as 2 for "Actives" and 1 for "Non-Actives." The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was based on the percent inhibition of specific E2-Alexa633 binding compared with activity cutoff (i.e., 60%). Compounds with percent inhibition below activity cutoff (i.e., Non-Active compounds) were given PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE of 0. Following equation was used to calculate PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE for Active compounds with percent inhibition above activity cutoff: PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - (100-%Inhibition)/Cutoff) where Cutoff was 60% and %Inhibition was the %inhibition above the Cutoff. The %Inhibition was calculated by: %Inhibition = 100 (1 - Sample MCF / Negative Control MCF) where Sample MCF was the Median Channel Fluorescence from sample well and Negative Control MCF was the average over assayed plate of Median Channel Fluorescence from the negative control wells (i.e., wells with DMSO vehicle only).
