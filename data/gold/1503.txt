The misregulation of protein folding often results in a variety of deleterious consequences on cellular function that range from the accumulation of protein aggregates leading to neurological disorders, to the inhibition of apoptosis in cancer cells. Several essential components of the protein folding machinery have been identified. For example, molecular chaperones interact with misfolded proteins and facilitate their refolding into native states. In E. coli, the chaperone DnaK is part of a multi-subunit complex that efficiently refolds proteins. Small molecules that inhibit DnaK could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of chaperones and their importance in other diseases. Inhibitors of DnaK might eventually be developed into novel antibiotics. DnaK consists of three domains: a 44 kDa nucleotide binding domain (residues 1-392), a 13kDa substrate binding domain (residues 393-507) and a 10 kDa alpha helical domain (residues 508-638). It has been proved that the substrate binding domain play a central role in the functions of chaperones. In addition, a deep hydrophobic pock of the substrate binding domain makes it a good target for the small organic molecules. In an earlier assay we screened libraries of small molecules for their ability to interact with the substrate binding domain of DnaK(AID 1033).  In this assay the most promising hit and its analogs were tested to determine their Minimal Inhibitory Concentration(MIC) for E. coli growth. Materials: 1)  Testing was done in Mueller-Hinton II broth (BBL). Protocols: 1) All compounds were first tested for their ability to limit cell growth of E. coli. 2) Compounds showing binding by NMR were tested over a range of concentrations. 3) E. coli growth in the presence of compounds were determined by mixing 90 uL of an OD600 = 0.001 with 10 uL of various concentrations of compound and grown overnight in a 96-well plate. 4) Optical density at 530 nm was measured using a Perkin Elmer Victor 2 Multilabel plate reader. Since DnaK is required for growth under heat shock conditions, we tested the compounds ability to kill E. coli at 42 oC. 5) The MIC was read as the concentration producing a greater than 2-fold reduction in growth
