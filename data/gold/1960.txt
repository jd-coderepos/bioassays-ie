Project Overview: In most organisms, the body axes and founding tissue types are formed prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts by maternally supplied RNA-binding proteins is crucial to early patterning events. Few tools exist to study specific regulatory networks guided by RNA-binding proteins during early development. Importantly, standard genetic analyses are complicated by the maternal effect, pleiotropy, and embryonic lethality. This screen aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNA-binding protein function for two proteins required for Caenorhabditis elegans early development. The rationale was two fold. First, inhibitory compounds would serve as a set of chemical tools to facilitate study of the RNA-binding proteins during subsequent aspects of development. Second, if the inhibitory compounds function across nematode species boundaries, then they may be useful as a new class of anti-parasitic agent that specifically targets Helminth embryos notoriously difficult to inactivate.  The two proteins chosen, MEX-5 and POS-1, belong to a family of conserved nematode CCCH class tandem zinc finger proteins. Both are critical to body axis formation and segregation of the germline from the soma. MEX-5 coordinates anterior cell fate specification, while POS-1 coordinates posterior patterning and germline specification. Both proteins can be expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as recombinant fusion proteins, and both proteins bind with high affinity to specific RNA sequences in vitro. Finally, fluorescence polarization can be used to effectively monitor the in vitro RNA-binding activity of both proteins using a standard fluorescence plate reader.  Expected Outcome: The ability of purified MEX-5 protein to change the anisotropy of fluorescently labeled RNAs upon binding is used as the basis of the assay. This biochemical assay will be used to screen for inhibitors of this interaction.  Compounds inhibiting the interaction with show a dose-dependent reduction in the polarization value (in mP.) 7.5 nL of compound per well was pre-dispensed into black Aurora 1536 low-base plates (PN 00029844) in duplicate assay plates.  Predispensed plates were stored lidded at room temperature for up to two weeks.  For higher concentrations in dose retests, 15 or 30 nL was predispensed. MEX-5 protein, expressed in E. coli JM109 with a C-terminal fusion to maltose binding protein, was prepared by the assay provider at approximately 50 uM as previously described.  A protein master mix was prepared at 200 nM in 1x buffer (20 mM tris pH 8.0 (Ambion), 40 mM NaCl (Ambion), 0.004% IPEGAL (Sigma), 100 uM zinc acetate dihydrate (Fluka)).  The solution was loaded on the dispenser (Combi nL, Thermo) at room temperature.  The target binding sequence TCR2 is a Temporal Control Region in the 3' untranslated region of the C. elegans gene glp-1 (abnormal Germ Line Proliferation).  Fluorescent TCR2 RNA (5'-UUUCUUUAUAACUUGUUACAAUUUUUGAAA-FITC-3', Dharmacon / Thermo) mastermix was prepared in 1x buffer and supplemented with 0.02 mg/mL tRNA type X (Sigma).  The RNA mastermix was heated at 65 degrees for 2 minutes then cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr, Beckman Coulter) at room temperature.  The dispenser bottle was wrapped in foil to protect from light. Competing unlabeled TCR2 RNA (Dharmacon / Thermo) was prepared as a positive control solution at 25 uM in 1x buffer.  The solution was heated to 65 degrees for 2 minutes and cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr) at room temperature. 1x buffer alone was also prepared and loaded onto the dispenser (BioRaptr). The assay plates with predispensed compound were filled with 4.5 uL / well of protein mastermix on the Combi nL and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then filled on the Bioratpr with 1.5 uL / well of labeled RNA mastermix and either 1.5 uL / well of 1x buffer only (compound wells and negative control DMSO wells) or 1.5 uL / well of competing RNA in 1x buffer (positive control wells). The final assay concentrations in 7.5 uL total volume were: 20 mM tris pH 8.0 40 mM NaCl 0.004% IPEGAL 100 uM zinc acetate 120 nM MEX5 protein 2 nM FITC labeled TCR2 RNA 4 ug/mL tRNA type X 10 uM test compound, 0.1% DMSO For positive control wells: 5 uM unlabeled TCR2 RNA Plates were spun at 1000 rpm (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6KR, GH3.8 rotor) for one minute. One hour after the addition of the RNA to the plates, fluorescence polarization was read on a ViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer) with a G factor of 1.  Total fluorescence from the P and S polarization channels was recorded along with the Fluorescence Polarization calculation.
