Late-stage counterscreen panel assay for S1P4 agonists: Ricerca HitProfilingScreen + CYP450. The purpose of this panel of binding assays performed by Ricerca Biosciences, LLC, is to identify a subset of potential receptors, transporters, ion channels, etc. for which the S1P4 agonist compound SID 87544119 displays affinity. Protocol Summary: Assays for CYP450, 1A2; CYP450, 2C19; CYP450, 2C9; CYP450, 2D6; and CYP450, 3A4 were enzyme assays using human recombinant insect Sf9 cells with 5 uM 3-cyano-7-ethoxycoumarin as substrate (except for CYP450, 3A4, which used 50 uM 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin as substrate). Detection was based on spectrofluorimetric quantitation of the enzymatic product produced. Assays for the other targets were radioligand binding assays. A response of  greater than or equal to 50% inhibition or stimulation is considered active. Negative inhibition represents a stimulation of binding. List of Reagents: Reagents were provided by Ricerca Biosciences, LLC.
