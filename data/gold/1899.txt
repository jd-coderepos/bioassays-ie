TR-FRET-based primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization. The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine the ability of test compounds to prevent dimerization of the hydrophilic N-terminal domain (residues 1-106; core106) of the HCV core protein (9). In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged GST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and subsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the Europium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies, blocking the transfer of energy from Europium to XL-665, and thus inhibiting well FRET. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of Flag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5 micromolar unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50% inhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of the incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). All wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM GST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 micromolar and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition controls, respectively. To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = ( I671nm / I617nm ) x 10,000 Where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound # Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / ( Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 micromolar of unlabelled Core106 protein. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have an activity score range of 0 to 41 and the active compounds have an activity score range of 41 to 100.
