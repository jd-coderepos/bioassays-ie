Dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1)," (PubChem AID 1040).  The compounds selected for testing in this AID met the following criteria:  1) they were active in AID 1040; 2) they confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Cell-based high-throughput confirmation assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1)," (PubChem AID 1254); and 3) they were inactive in a set of experiments entitled, "Counterscreen assay for antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY-Y1): Cell-based high throughput assay to measure NPY-Y2 antagonism." (PubChem AID 1255). A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism.  As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. To measure NPY-Y1 antagonism, adenylate cyclase activity was activated by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Isoproterenol increased the concentration of cAMP, and therefore probe fluorescence via the activated CNG channel. The addition of the agonist NPY peptide counteracted the accumulation of cAMP induced by isoproterenol. Effective NPY-Y1 receptor antagonists therefore would reverse this reduction in NPY-mediated fluorescence, yielding higher fluorescence units.  Test compounds were assayed in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 micromolar. The Y1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH).  The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y1 cells in a 4 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates.  Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.  The assay was started by dispensing 2 ul per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours.  Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices).  Then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 ul of NPY at its EC95 (10 nM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells.  The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 ul of a solution containing isoproterenol (1 uM final nominal concentration; EC100) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, (25 uM final nominal concentration) in PBS.  The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = (T45 / T0) Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows: % Inhibition = [1-((Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control)/ (Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control))]*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and isoproterenol. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 35 uM) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 35 uM. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 uM were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.
