Fluorescence counterscreen assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1: Cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y2. The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1304) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Confirmation cell-based high-throughput screening assay for potentiators or agonists of NPY-Y1" (PubChem AID 1546), were nonselective due to activation of NPY-Y2. In this assay, a cell line transfected with Y2 and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNGC) is used to measure potentiation of the NPY response or direct agonism by test compound of the Y1 receptor. The cells are treated with isoproterenol to activate adenylate cyclase, therefore increasing cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, and as a consequence CNGC activity. Changes in CNGC activity also change the cell membrane potential, which is measured using a fluorescent probe. As designed, a test compound that acts as an Y2 potentiator or agonist will increase Y2 activity, leading to decreased cAMP levels, reduced CNG channel opening and probe fluorescence, thus leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM. The Y2 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 250 micrograms/mL Geneticin, 1 microgram/mL Puromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, 3600 Y2 HEK293-CNG cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 23 hours at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The assay was started by dispensing 2 microliters per well of 4.5x concentrated probe loading dye into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by dispensing 2 microliters of NPY (200 pM final concentration) in 0.1% BSA. Next, 32 nL of test compound (3.6 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO (0.4% final concentration) or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, followed by challenge with 1 microliter of a solution containing isoproterenol at its EC100 (1 micromolar final concentration) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, in PBS (25 micromolar final concentration). The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings. The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data: Ratio = T45 / T0 Where T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of compounds and challenge and T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of compounds and challenge. The percent activation for each compound was calculated using: % Activation = (MedianRatio_Test_Compound - MedianRatio_Low_Control)/ (MedianRatio_High_Control - MedianRatio_Low_Control)*100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, NPY and isoproterenol. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 40 nM NPY (EC100) and isoproterenol. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, 200 pM NPY (EC10) and isoproterenol. Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the Y2 Potentiator Primary Screen was declared active. The reported PubChem activity score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The inactive compounds of this assay have activity score range of 0 to 32 and active compounds range of activity score is 33 to 100.
