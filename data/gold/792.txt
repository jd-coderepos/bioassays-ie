eIF2B is a translation initiation factor that functions in the first step of protein synthesis. It is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), converting eIF2 (inactive GDP-bound form) to eIF2GTP (active). Mutations of eIF2B manifest as a dysfunction in brain myelin leading to its progressive loss. This causes fatal conditions known as Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination syndrome (CACH) and leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM). As eIF2B is a universally conserved protein among eukaryotic organisms, a cellular assay system has been developed using yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (wild type and eIF2B-epsilon-R284H mutant). Yeast eIF2B-epsilon-R284H is equivalent to the human eIF2B5-R299H mutation. The HTS is aimed at identifying compounds that can restore eIF2B function. The screen is a reporter-gene assay. GCN4 activity is inversely proportional to eIF2B function in cells. Thus cells with eIF2B mutations exhibit aberrantly high GCN4 expression. The mutant cells contain a chromosomally-integrated gene-fusion to beta-galactosidase. Beta-Galactosidase monitoring thus indirectly measures GCN4 levels and, in turn, eIF2B activity. To perform the assay, we have adapted a coupled beta-galactosidase/ firefly luciferase system (Promega) for use with yeast cells and in HTS format. The growth of mutant and wildtype yeast in the presence of each compound was also monitored and used as a measure of compound toxicity. Mutant yeast cells were grown in 384-well polypropylene plates sealed with Breathe-Easy membranes at 30 C for 16 hrs. After 16 hrs, the cells were mixed using Perkin Elmer Evolution by repeated aspirate-dispense cycles using 30 uL disposable tips. A portion of the cell suspension was lysed with Z-buffer (82 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 9 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1% SDS) in a white 384-well plate. Beta-Glo reagent was added to the lysed cells, and luminescence was measured after 90 min. at room temperature. The remaining cells were transferred to a clear 384-well plate and absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a Perkin Elmer Envision spectrophotometer. HTS was performed using 25 uM compound as described below. The screen was repeated using the wild-type yeast cells as a filter to identify compounds having a non-specific effect on the luminescence of both mutant and wild-type yeast.
