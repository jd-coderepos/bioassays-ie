The primary pathophysiological change giving rise to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that are involved in modulating the function of basal ganglia (BG) nuclei. Unfortunately, traditional therapies for treatment of PD based on dopamine replacement strategies eventually fail in most patients and are associated with numerous side effects. A great deal of effort has been focused on developing a detailed understanding of the circuitry and function of the BG to develop novel, nondopaminergic, approaches for restoring normal BG function in PD patients.  Exciting advances suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including the group III mGluRs (mGluR4, -7 and -8), play important roles in regulating transmission through the BG and could serve as targets for novel PD therapeutics Basic protocol: 1. Cells are plated at a density of 20,000 cells/20 ul well 1 day prior to assay in Assay Media (DMEM with 20mM HEPES, 10% dialyzed FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate). 2. The following day, media is removed from the cells. 3. 20 ul/well of Fluo-4 AM dye (1 uM) in Assay Buffer (HBSS + 2.5mM probenecid) is added. 4. The plates are incubated for 45 min to one hour at RT. 5. Dye is removed from the cells. 6. 20 ul of assay buffer is added and removed. 20 ul of assay buffer is added. 8. Plates are loaded into a Hamamatsu FDSS. 9. Compounds are tested for selectivity at a 10 uM final concentration (prepared as a 2X stock, 20 ul added per well) and the agonist is added at a 5X concentration (10 ul of agonist added per well, 50 uL total volume). A baseline read is taken for 1.5 seconds, the first addition (compound or DMSO-matched vehicle) occurs at 1.5 seconds and the second addition (agonist) is added at 142 seconds. The read continues for 300 seconds. Data analysis: Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Raw data were opened in Excel and each data point in a given trace was divided by the first data point from that trace (static ratio). For experiments in which antagonists/potentiators were added, data were again normalized by dividing each point by the fluorescence value immediately before the agonist addition to correct for any subtle differences in the baseline traces after the compound incubation period. The max fluorescence increase beginning after the agonist addition was calculated.  Curves were fitted using a four point logistical equation using Microsoft XLfit (IDBS, Bridgewater, NJ). This compound was not active as a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR5 and was assigned an 'Outcome' of 'Inactive' and a 'Score' of '0'. Furthermore, the 3-fold decrease in glutamate EC50 in the presence of compound would suggest antagonistic modulation.
