A cell line containing the human S1P1 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1 activation. Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism was measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases the production of cAMP and therefore the transcription of the CRE-BLA reporter gene. S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect; similarly agonism potentiators would increase the potency of an S1P1 agonist. Therefore the amount of BLA activity was inversely proportional to the concentration of agonist or agonism potentiators in the presence of an S1P1 agonist. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. The primary HTS assay was conducted in 1536-well format. All compounds were tested once at a 10 micromolar final concentration. The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. As with the primary run, SEW-2871 was used as the positive control. All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of 1 micromolar SEW-2871 (i.e. 100% agonist) Vs wells that contained forskolin only (0% agonist). Dose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (95 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the EC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with EC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. In addition to determining the Ec50 values for the #potentiator assay#, Ec50 values were also determined for the S1P1 assay in #Agonist# mode as well as counterscreened for EC50 values in the parental CHO Cre Bla cell line. These three assay results are submitted as individual publications. For the S1P1 agonist assay execution, all parameters are identical to the #potentiator# assay except test wells only include forskolin devoid of the Ec20 concentration of SEW 2871. For the parental CHO Cre Bla cell counterscreen assay all parameters were again identical to the #potentiator assay except this cell line doesn#t express S1P1 and was tested in the presence of 4uM forskolin only. Ec50#s for these two assays were plotted using the same parameters as above. For the agonist assay, data was normalized to the 1micromolar SEW-2871 Vs forskolin only and for the parental cell counterscreen, data was normalized to untreated cells Vs forskolin treated cells. The activity score was calculated based on pEC50 values for compounds for which an exact EC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pEC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pEC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact EC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested. The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 C in 5% CO2.  The next day, 48 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of a mixture of forskolin and SEW2871 was dispensed to all compound & control wells at a final concentration of 4 micromolar (forskolin#s EC80) and 2 nanomolar (SEW2871#s EC20), respectively. Additionally, 48 nL of SEW2871 was also added to designated positive control wells to a final concentration of 1 micromolar (i.e. its EC100). Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen LiveBLAzer part#K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer#s protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma part#P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting #background# (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the basal signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.
