To further establish activity of potential coactivator binding inhibitors (CBIs) as inhibitors of estrogen signaling, we have assayed these compounds in cell-based cotransfection reporter gene assays of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription.  A human endometrial cancer cell line (HEC-1) that expresses nuclear receptor coactivators but contains no endogenous ER alpha was transfected with a full-length ER alpha expression vector, an estrogen-responsive luciferase reporter gene plasmid (2ERE Luc), and pCMV beta-galactosidase (beta-gal; internal control).  The transfected cells were incubated with two different concentrations of estradiol (E2) and increasing concentrations of CBI; luciferase activity was then measured.  If the compound acts by a coactivator binding inhibition mechanism - that is, by directly competing with the SRCs - then a change in the concentration of E2 should have no effect on the IC50 of the compound.  We see no change in compound IC50 in the presence of either 1 nM or 100 nM E2, indicating that the inhibition of transcription is, in fact, occurring by a coactivator binding inhibition mechanism. An internal beta-galactosidase control suggests that the cells are viable at all concentrations of the CBIs, verifying that the effect of the CBIs is not due to general cell toxicity. Compounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 629 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-alpha Coactivator Binding Inhibitors, were selected for testing in this assay. Human endometrial cancer cells (HEC-1) were maintained in culture as described and transfected in 24 well plates.  A mixture of HBSS (50 uL/well), Holo-transferrin (Sigma T1408) (20 uL/well), and lipofectin (Invitrogen #18292-011) (5 uL/well) were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The DNA mixture was made by adding 200 ng of pCMV alpha-galactosidase as internal control, 500 ng of the estrogen responsive reporter gene plasmid 2ERE Luc, and 100 ng of full-length ER-beta; expression vector with 75 uL HBSS per well and allowed to incubate after addition of the first mixture for 20 minutes at room temperature. The cell media was changed to Opti-MEM (350 uL/well) and 150 uL of the transfection mixture was added to each well.  The cells were incubated at 37 deg C in a 5% CO2 containing incubator for 6 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing 5% charcoal-dextran-treated calf serum and the desired concentrations of ligands. Reporter gene activity was assayed at 24 h after ligand addition. Luciferase activity, normalized for the internal control &#946;-galactosidase activity, was assayed as described. In the initial screen, antagonist activity is determined at four concentrations of compound increasing to 10 &#956;M, in the presence of 10-9 M E2.    The EC50, where one could be determined, is reported under 1nM E2 conditions. If an EC50 could be determined, the Activity Outcome is set to Active, and the Activity Score is set to 100.  In other cases, the Activity Outcome is set to Inactive, and Activity Score is set to 0.
