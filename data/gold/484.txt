As with the primary HTS assay, the same cell line containing the human S1P3 receptor as well as the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 antagonism. When the S1P3 receptor was stimulated by S1P agonist, transcription of the NFAT-BLA gene occurred via a G-alpha-16 protein coupled signaling cascade. The amount of BLA activity was proportional to the concentration of agonist. In this assay, in order to measure antagonist activity, test wells containing cells were treated with the Ec80 of the agonist S1P which was 800nM. BLA activity was measured with a fluorescent BLA substrate. In this experiment, 209 compounds that passed hit selection criteria, were tested for individual IC50 determination. Compounds that were unavailable for "hit picking" were not followed up on. The compounds were "hit-picked" at a 10 millimolar concentration in DMSO and further serially diluted nine times at three fold-dilutions for a total of 10 different compound concentrations . Each compound dilution series was assayed in triplicate. The entire campaign was run with the Ec80 of S1P as the negative control (0% Inhibition) Vs basal cells as the positive control (100% inhibition). All data reported was normalized on a per-plate basis to wells that contained cells in the presence of media only; i.e. 0% activation which should be concordant with 100% inhibition. The assay was conducted in 1536-well format. Dose-response curves were plotted and fitted to a four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported IC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for x-intercept at the 50% activity level of Y-intercept. In cases where the highest concentration tested (49.8 micromolar) did not result in > 50% inhibition or where no curve fit was achieved, the IC50 was determined manually depending on the observed inhibition at the individual concentrations. Compounds with IC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive, compounds with IC50 equal to less than 10 micromolar are considered active. The activity score was calculated based on pIC50 values for compounds for which an exact IC50 value was calculated and based on the observed pIC50 range, specifically the maximum lower limit of the pIC50 value as calculated from the lowest concentration for which greater than 50% inhibition is observed. This results in a conservative estimate of the activity score for compounds for which no exact IC50 value is given while maintaining a reasonable rank order of all compounds tested. For all assays, a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line stably transfected with human S1P3 receptor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell-beta lactamase (NFAT-BLA) reporter construct and the G-alpha-16 pathway coupling protein was used. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm Corning flasks (part 431080) at 37 deg C and 95% RH. The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 11965-092) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum (Hyclone, part SH30541.03), 0.1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen, part 1114-050), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen, part 11360-070), 25 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, part 15630-080), 5 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen, part 25030-081), 2 mg/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen, part 10131-027), 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, part 10687-010) and 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, part 15140-122). Prior to the assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 1.25 million/milliliter in phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (Invitrogen, part 21063-029) containing 0.5% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, part SH30068.03), 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, and 5 mM L-Glutamine. The assay began by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each test well of a 1536 well plate. The cells were then allowed to incubate in the plates overnight at 37 deg C in 5% CO2. The next day, 25 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One microliter of S1P [Ec80] was added to test wells and was also added to the appropriate negative control wells to a final concentration of 0.8 micromolar. Plates were then incubated at 37 deg C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer's fluorescent substrate mixture (Invitrogen, LiveBLAzer, part K1085), prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 200 mM probenicid (Sigma, part P8761) was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm & 460 nm. Each channel of raw data was corrected by subtracting "background" (i.e. wells containing media and substrate only) before the ratio of 460 nm/535 nm fluorescence emission was calculated. Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio of the positive control after subtracting the negative control signal ratio from the sample well and the positive control.
