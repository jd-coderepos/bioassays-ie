The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. This assay was previously used in a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign with 24,306 compounds to identify 181 with FPR binding activity (AID 440) and an additional 72 with FPRL1 binding activity (AID 441). The primary HTS assay was performed in 384-well format at a compound concentration of 6.7 microM. In the present study, the 252 compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the two primary HTS assays (> 30% inhibition of fluorescent ligand binding) were tested in a dose response format to confirm activity and determine potency. The compounds were hit-picked at a 10 milliM concentration in DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations. The FPR dose response assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately (AID 519) and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPRL1 binding activity identified in this report. Likewise, FPRL1 binding results reported here represent counter-screen data with which to determine the selectivity and specificity of compounds identified to have FPR binding activity in the FPR dose-response assay report (AID 520). For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well. The fluorescent Wpep ligand had a Kd of 8 nanoM for FPRL1 and was used at a final concentration of 5 nanoM. Ki determinations were used as the basis of distinguishing active and inactive test compounds in the dose response assay.
