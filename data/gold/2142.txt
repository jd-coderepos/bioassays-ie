Late stage results from the probe development effort to identify antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY-Y2). NPY Y2 Inhibition Assays (Assays 1 and 2): The purpose of these assays is to determine the ability of test compounds to inhibit NPY-Y2.  A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y2 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y2 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration.  Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 2.8 micromolar (Assay 1) or in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 micromolar (Assay 2). NPY-Y1 Inhibition Counterscreen Assays (Assays 3 and 4): The purpose of these assays is to determine the ability of test compounds to inhibit NPY-Y1.  A cell line transfected with the NPY-Y1 receptor and a cyclic-nucleotide gated channel (CNG) were used to measure receptor antagonism. As designed, an NPY-Y1 antagonist increases the concentration of agonist-abrogated cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and therefore causes the opening of the CNG channel. Once open, the CNG channel changes the cell membrane potential. A fluorescent probe can be used to measure this change in membrane potential; in this assay an increase or decrease in the probe's fluorescence correlates to an increase or decrease, respectively, in cAMP concentration. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 3.5 micromolar (Assay 3) or in triplicate in a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 35 micromolar (Assay 4). Cytotoxicity Assay (Assay 5): The purpose of this assay is to determine whether compounds of interest reduce cell viability.  Y2R HEK293-CNG cells were seeded at 500 cells per well in 1536-well plates in 5 uL growth media. Compounds (in DMSO) were prepared as 10-point, 1:3 serial dilutions starting at 11 uM final concentration were added to cells. Plates were incubated for 24, 48 or 72 h at 37 C.  After incubation, 5 uL of CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI) were added to each well and the plates were allowed to incubate for 15 min at room temperature.  Luminescence was then measured (ViewLux plate reader, PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland). Viability was measured as a percentage relative to control cells treated with DMSO alone (0% cytotoxicity) and cells treated with 100 uM Doxorubicin (100% cytotoxicity). Brain Penetrance Assays (Assay 6): Plasma and brain levels of the compounds were assessed in C57Bl6 mice 30 minutes after dosing 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Samples were formulated at 2 mg/mL in 10/10/80 DMSO/tween/water. Blood was collected into EDTA containing tubes at 30 min and plasma was generated using standard centrifugation techniques. Brain samples were frozen upon collection and all samples were stored at -80 C until analyzed. Brain tissue was not perfused prior to freezing to prevent diffusion of the compound out of the tissue during the process. Plasma samples were analyzed by treating 25 &#956;L of plasma with 125 &#956;L of acetonitrile containing an internal standard (propanolol) and filtering through a Millipore Multiscreen Solvinter 0.45 &#956;m low binding PTFE hydrophilic filter. The filtrate was analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an API Sciex 4000. MRM methods were developed in positive ion mode and concentrations were determined using a standard curve between 2 to 2000 ng/mL. Samples with concentrations outside of the curve were diluted with blank plasma and reanalyzed. Similar conditions were used to determine brain levels except the samples were weighed and acetonitrile was added (10x, weight by volume). The samples were sonicated to extract the compound from the brain matrix and then filtered as described above. A density of 1 g/mL was used to convert compound per mg tissue into molar equivalents.
