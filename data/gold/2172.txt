Counterscreen for HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors: Fluorescence-based biochemical high-throughput dose response assay for compounds that cause fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based counterscreen assay for HCV NS3 helicase inhibitors: biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that cause fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) in triplicate" (AID 1945). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for "Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)", (AID 1800) to determine whether the compounds are nonselective due to direct DNA binding. In this biochemical assay, a DNA hairpin oligonucleotide is incubated with test compound and a fluorescent intercalating agent, ethidium bromide. Upon binding to the DNA molecule, the fluorescence of the intercalating agent increases. As designed, test compounds that bind to the DNA molecule will compete with and displace the intercalating agent, resulting in a decrease in well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 79.4 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS, pH 6.5) were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO, diminazene aceturate (80 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing into all wells 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 4 micromolar ethidium bromide and 0.32 micromolar hairpin oligonucleotide. Well fluorescence was read after 10 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent Displacement = ( test_compound_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) / ( positive_control_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_ Ratio_RFU ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing diminazene aceturate. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 79.4 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50/ was determined manually as greater than 79.4 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for inactive compounds is 100-0. There are no actives.
