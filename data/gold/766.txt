Assay for Formylpeptide Receptor Family Ligands The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. Previously, 24,304 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) were screened to identity FPR ligands. Primary HTS assays (AID 441), dose response assays (AID 520), counter-screens against the related FPRL1 receptor (AIDs 440 and 519), and secondary intracellular calcium response assays (AID 698) identified 3 novel and selective small molecule FPRL1 antagonists. Two major chemotype families representing the most potent FPR ligands (inhibition constants, Ki, of 1 to 10 microM) were selected for follow up structure activity relationship (SAR) evaluation. A set of 170 compounds was selected by application of computational screening techniques (2D substructure search)to a 700k subset of the ChemDiv collection of more than 1 million compounds. The compounds were purchased and screened in a primary HTS FPRL-FPRL1 duplex assay, results of which have been reported separately. There were 13 compounds that satisfied hit selection criteria in the primary HTS assay (> 30% inhibition of fluorescent ligand binding). These were tested in a dose response format in the FPR-FPRL1 duplex assay to confirm activity and determine potency. The FPRL1 dose response assay results are reported here. The FPR dose response assay results obtained in parallel in the same wells have been reported separately and represent counter-screen data with which to determine selectivity and specificity of compounds with FPRL1 binding activity identified in this report. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.
