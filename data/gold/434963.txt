Fluorescence-based cell-based high throughput confirmation assay for agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR). The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR)" (AID 2435). In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR agonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 uM. Protocol Summary: The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Next, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin. The average percent activation and standard deviation of each compound tested were calculated. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: Any compound that exhibited a percent activation greater than the hit cutoff calculated for the primary screen (AID 2435) was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. % Activation values of greater than or equal to 100 are reported as activity score 100. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero. The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-6, for inactive 5-0.
