Assay for Formylpeptide Receptor Family Ligands The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPR. The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1. The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis. A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity. Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively. WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors. Previously, 24,304 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) were screened to identity FPRL1 ligands. Primary HTS assays (AID 441), dose response assays (AID 520), counter-screens against the related FPRL1 receptor (AIDs 440 and 519), and secondary intracellular calcium response assays (AID 698) identified 3 novel and selective small molecule FPRL1 antagonists. In the present analysis, 2 major chemotype families representing the most potent FPRL1 ligands (inhibition constants, Ki, of 1 to 10 microM) were selected for follow up structure activity relationship (SAR) evaluation. A set of 170 compounds was selected by application of computational screening techniques (2D substructure search) to a 700k subset of the ChemDiv collection of more than 1 million compounds. The compounds were purchased for physical screening. The FPRL1 primary HTS assay was performed in 384 well format. Test compounds were assessed at a single concentration ranging from 3.9 to 8.3 microM (mean +- SD = 5.5 +- 0.8 microM) for the ability to inhibit fluorescent ligand binding, detected as a decrease in cell fluorescence due to displacement of fluorescent ligand from FPRL1. For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control). fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps. The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min. The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well.
