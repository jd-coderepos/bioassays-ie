The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS. The purpose of this experiment was to test compounds of interest against the muscarinic M5 receptor for their ability to modulate [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) binding. NMS acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Experimental Protocol: Membranes were prepared from M5-expressing CHO cells as described [5]. Binding reactions contained 0.1 nM [3H]-NMS, 20 micrograms of membranes and compound or vehicle (0.3% DMSO, final, to define total binding) or 1 micromolar atropine (to define nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 500 microliters. The KD of [3H]-NMS was determined empirically to be 0.21 nM. Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO, then diluted in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to give a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% in the binding reaction. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on a Lab-Line Titer plate shaker at setting 7 (~750 rpm). Reactions were stopped and membranes collected onto 96-well Barex microplates with GF/B filter (1 micrometer pore size) using a Brandel harvester and washed 3X with ice-cold harvesting buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4). Filter plates were dried overnight and counted in a PerkinElmer TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). For acetylcholine affinity experiments, the KI of an acetylcholine competition curve was determined in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations (3 to 30 micromolar, final) of test compound. Actual [3H]-NMS concentrations were back-calculated after counting aliquots of 5X [3H]-NMS added to the reaction. Radioligand depletion was routinely kept to approximately 5% or less. Data Fitting: Data from the Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation plate reader was normalized using the maximum specific binding of the radioligand. The data were input into GraphPad Prism version 5.01 and fitted to a one site competition model using least squares fit with no constraints and no weighting. Atropine was used to determine non-specific binding. Compounds at concentrations upto 30 micromolar did not fit a  full sigmoidal dose-response curve and hence, reliable descriptive statistics could not be determined. The 'Score' was assigned as '30' to reflect dose dependency and the 'Outcome' was assigned as 'Inconclusive.'
