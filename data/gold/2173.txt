Fluorescence-based biochemical high throughput dose response assay for inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3). The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in set of previous experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)" (AID 1800) and that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled, "Fluorescence-based confirmation biochemical high throughput screening assay for inhibitors of the Hepatitis C Virus non-structural protein 3 helicase (NS3)" (AID 1943). In this assay, a ssDNA oligonucleotide molecular beacon substrate, featuring a 5' fluorescent Cy5 moiety and a 3' quencher, is annealed to a second longer DNA oligonucleotide. Upon strand separation by NS3 helicase and ATP, the beacon strand forms an intramolecular hairpin that brings the tethered fluorophore and quencher molecules into juxtaposition, quenching fluorescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit helicase activity at 60 minutes (T60) will prevent hairpin formation and interaction of the Cy5 fluorophore and quencher, thus preventing quenching of well fluorescence. A T0 fluorescence measurement is also performed to identify compounds that quench and enhance Cy5 fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 109 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 4 microliters of Assay Buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 12.5 mM Tween20, 6 micrograms/mL BSA) containing 13.89 nM NS3 helicase fragment and 5.56 nM NS3 substrate were dispensed into wells of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test compound in DMSO, thioflavine S (110 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 1 microliter of 5 mM ATP into all wells. Well fluorescence was read after 1 hour of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). Prior to inhibition calculations the ratio between RFU values obtained at t0 (RFU_t0) and t60 (RFU_t60), named Ratio_RFU, was calculated as follows: Ratio_RFU = RFU_t60/RFU_t0 The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows: Percent inhibition = ( test_compound_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) / ( positive_control_Ratio_RFU - negative_control_Ratio_RFU ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing Thioflavine S. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (Symyx Technologies Inc). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by  solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 109 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50/ was determined manually as greater than 109 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-82, for inactive 79-0.
