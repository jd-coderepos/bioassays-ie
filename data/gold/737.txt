To identify novel compounds that can act as estrogenic activators, a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) has been developed in a 384-well format.  This assay monitors the potentiation of the binding of a Cy5-labeled SRC-1 peptide to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER-alpha labeled (via a streptavidin-biotin interaction) with a long-lifetime europium. The interaction of ER-alpha with SRC1 under a low estradiol concentration brings europium and Cy5 into proximity, generating basal level of FRET. Compounds that can further enhance the interaction with increased FRET signal are identified as positives for further analysis. These compounds could either be conventional ligand agonists or potentiators of coactivator-ER-alpha binding that operate by a mechanism distinct from binding as agonists in the ligand binding pocket. Distinction between these two mechanisms requires various counter-screening assays. Compounds identified as active from the primary screen, AID 639 - HTS of Estrogen Receptor-alpha Coactivator Binding Potentiators, were selected for testing in this assay.  Each compound was tested in 6 concentration, 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a nominal test concentration of 50 micromolar. Each concentration was tested in triplicate.  1. Assay buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01% NP40 2. ER-alpha protein: Biotin-labeled ER-alpha-LBD protein 3. 17 beta-estradiol 4. Lance Eu-W1024 labeled-streptavidin (SA-Eu) 5. SRC-Cy5 peptide 6. Positive Control: SRC1-BOX II peptide 1. Make assay reaction buffer for HTS that contains recombinant ER-alpha protein (0.3 nM, final concentration), SRC-Cy5 peptide (2 nM, final concentration), 17 beta-estradiol (1 uM, final concentration) and SA-Eu (0.5 nM, final concentration). 2. Dispense 19 uL of assay reaction buffer to 384-well black assay plate. 3. Add library compound (1 mM in DMSO) to each well and incubate plates at room temperature for 2 hr. 4. Record FRET signals with an Analyst HT reader (Molecular Devices). An excitation filter at 330 nm and emission filters at 620 nm and 665 nm are used with a dichroic mirror of 380 nm. 1. FRET signals are expressed as FRET ratios: FRET  = F665 nm / F620 nm * 10000 2. Assay data are analyzed using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft. Percentage of control is calculated with the following equation based on data from each plate. % of Control = ((FRETcompound - FRETpeptide only) / (FRETcontrol -FRET peptide only)) * 100 Where FRETcompound is the FRET ratio from a well with a test compound, FRET peptide only is an average FRET signal from wells with SRC-Cy5 peptide only; FRET signal control is an average FRET ratio from wells containing Eu-ER-alpha protein and SRC-Cy5 peptide, which defines maximal FRET. For each compound, a 4 parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted using BioAssay software from CambridgeSoft, using this equation: Y = ((Top-Bottom)/(1+(X/X50)^Curvature))+Bottom The fitted value of X50 is reported as the EC50.  In some cases, no curve could be fit to the data: When no EC50 could be determined, a value of 9999 was substituted for the EC50. When no EC50 could be determined, a value of 10000 was substituted for the EC50 Standard Error. When no EC50 could be determined, a value of -1 was substituted for the Pct Control at EC50. When no EC50 could be determined, a value of 0 was substituted for the R2 value. The Pct of Control at the EC50 was then determined, representing the level of potentiation that this compound provided at the EC50 mark.  However, in some cases the standard error of the EC50 value was judged to be too high to be a reliable result. When an acceptable EC50 was determined by curve fitting, the Percent of Control at the Ec50 is reported as the "Reported Pct Control". When no EC50 could be determined, or when the EC50 standard error was judged to be too high, the percentage of control at 12.5 uM concentration is reported as the "Reported Pct Control".  The outcome was determined as follows: When an acceptable EC50 was determined by curve fitting, compounds with EC50 < 30 uM were reported as Active. when no acceptable EC50 was determined, compounds with Reported Pct Control >300% were reported as Active. The activity score was calculated based on the observed range of the Reported Pct Control values obtained, according to the following formula: PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 100 * (1 - ((IC50 - HighestPctControl) / (HighestPctControl - LowestPctControl)))
