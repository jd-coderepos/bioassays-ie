The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)" (AID 1700), that confirmed activity in a set of experiments entitled "Luminescence-based confirmation cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5)" (AID 1834), and that were inactive in a set of previous experiments entitled, "Luminescence-based counterscreen assay for KLF5 inhibitors: cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify cytotoxic compounds using the IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line in triplicate" (AID 1905). This assay also serves as a counterscreen to determine whether these compounds are cytotoxic to non-transformed IEC-6 rat intestinal epithelial cells. In this assay, rat IEC-6 cells are incubated with tests compounds, followed by determination of cell viability. The assay utilizes the CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent (Promega) to measure intracellular ATP in viable cells. Luciferase present in the reagent catalyzes the oxidation of beetle luciferin to oxyluciferin and light in the presence of cellular ATP. Well luminescence is directly proportional to ATP levels and cell viability. As designed, compounds that reduce cell viability will reduce ATP levels, luciferin oxidation and light production, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 40 micromolar. The parental IEC-6 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 10% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 2 micrograms/ml human recombinant insulin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay 1250 cells in a 5 microliter volume of growth media were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 20 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.4 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or doxorubicin (150 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 microliters of CellTiter-Glo reagent to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
