Dose Response Cell-Based Assay for Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 1 (S1P1): Purchased Analogues. The purpose of this assay is to determine dose response curves for purchased structural analogues of an S1P3 agonist (SID 7967985) identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "S1P3 Agonist Dose-Response Potency Assay" (PubChem AID 439). This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a recent set of experiments entitled, "Dose Response Cell-Based Assay for Agonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3): Purchased Analogues" (PubChem AID 1192). In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P1 (pcDNA3.1-S1P1) and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the cAMP Response Element (CRE) promoter was used to measure S1P1 agonism by test compound.  Since the S1P1 receptor is a member of Gi/o protein coupled receptor family, agonism was measured by adding test compounds in the presence of a forskolin challenge. Through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, forskolin increases production of cAMP and therefore transcription of the CRE-BLA reporter gene, as measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate.  S1P1 agonists would abrogate this effect.  As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P1 agonist will increase S1P1 activity, inhibit BLA transcription, leading to reduced well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in 384-well plates using ten 1:3 serial dilutions, starting at a nominal test concentration of 10 uM. Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B and 1x penicillin-streptomycin.  Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.3 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 10 ul of cell suspension (3000 cells) to each well, followed by incubation for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2.  Then 10 nL of test compound or DMSO control was added. One ul of forskolin (2 uM final concentration) was dispensed to test and negative control wells. Additionally, 1.1 ul of SEW2871 (1 uM final concentration) was added to designated positive control wells.  Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 4 hrs. After the incubation, 2.2 ul/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 15 mM probenecid, was added. After 2 hours of incubation at room temperature in the dark, plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 590 nm and 460 nm. To normalize assay data, values measured from the probe's fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I590 nm/I460 nm where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = 100*[1 - ((Ratio_Test_Compound -Median_Ratio_Positive_Control) / abs(Median_Ratio_Positive_Control - Median_Ratio_Negative_Control)) Where: Test compound is defined as wells containing test compound and forskolin Negative_Control is defined as wells containing forskolin High_Control is defined as wells containing SEW2871 and forskolin For each test compound, percent activation was plotted against compound concentration.  A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal concentration-response curve with adjustable baseline was fitted using Assay Explorer software by MDL. The reported EC50 values are generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept at the 50% activity level of the Y-intercept value.  In cases where the highest concentration tested (10 uM) did not result in 50% activation, the EC50 was determined manually as > 10 uM.  Compounds with EC50 values of greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive.  Compounds with EC50 values equal to or less than 10 uM were considered active. The activity score is reported as normalized EC50 for samples with EC50 of less than 10 uM and as zero for samples with EC50 greater than or equal to 10 uM. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero.  Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero.  Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.
