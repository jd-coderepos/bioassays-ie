Formyl peptide receptors.  The G-protein coupled formylpeptide receptor (FPR) was one of the originating members of the chemoattractant receptor superfamily The assay reported here uses flow cytometry to measure test compound competition with a high-affinity fluorescent ligand for binding to human FPRL1.  The assay was performed in a "duplex" format in which U937 cells expressing FPR were tested together with a Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell line that expressed the related receptor, FPRL1.  The FPR-expressing cells were stained with a red-fluorescent dye, FURA-red, to allow them to be distinguished from the FPRL1-expressing cells during flow cytometric analysis.  A fluorescein label was conjugated to the lysine residue of the peptide, WKYMVm (WPep), to produce a fluorescent ligand (WPep-FITC) that bound FPR and FPRL-1 with high affinity.  Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of WPep-FITC to FPR and FPRL1 were determined to be 10 nM and 8 nM, respectively.  WPep-FITC was used as the fluorescent ligand in the duplex FPR-FPRL1 assay to determine compound activity for both receptors.  For assay performance, additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1) test compounds and control reagents (5 microL/well); 2) a combination of FPR- and FPRL1-expressing cell lines (10^7/mL each, 5 microL/well); 3) (after 30 min, 4 degrees C incubation) fluorescent peptide (5 microL/well). After an additional 45 min, 4 degrees C incubation, plates were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing unlabeled receptor-blocking peptide (positive control) or buffer (negative control).  fMLFF (4Pep) was used as the FPR-blocking peptide, unlabeled WPep as the FPRL1-blocking peptide. The assay was homogeneous in that cells, compounds and fluorescent peptide were added in sequence and the wells subsequently analyzed without intervening wash steps.  The HyperCyt high throughput flow cytometry platform  was used to sequentially sample cells from wells of 384-well microplates (2 microL/sample) for flow cytometer presentation at a rate of 40 samples/min.  The resulting time-resolved data files were analyzed with IDLeQuery software to determine compound activity in each well. Test compound inhibition of fluorescent peptide binding was calculated as %Inhibition = 100 x [1 - (MFI_test - MFI_PC)/(MFI_NC - MFI_PC)] in which MFI_Test, MFI_PC and MFI_NC represent the median fluorescence intensity of cells in wells containing test compound, the average MFI of cells in positive control wells and the average MFI of cells in negative control wells, respectively. Test compounds were hit-picked at a 10 milliM concentration in DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 eight times for a total of nine different test compound concentrations.  Final concentrations in the assay ranged from 10.2 nanoM to 66.7 microM. In an individual dose response experiment, each compound was tested in duplicate to result in 18 data points. Some compounds were tested in more than one dose-response experiment. The number of data points for dose response curves ranged from 18 (a single experiment) to 90 (5 experiments). In some cases individual data points were determined to be statistical outliers and were eliminated from the analysis. FPRL1 expression ranged from 100,000 to 200,000 receptors per cell in different assays as determined by comparison to standard curves generated with Fluorescein Reference Standard Microbeads (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN).  This corresponded to total FPRL1 concentrations of 0.6 to 1.2 nanoM.  To account for effects of possible ligand depletion at the higher receptor concentrations, inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from IC50 estimates Ki determinations were used as the basis of distinguishing active and inactive test compounds in the dose response assay. Test compounds with Ki less than 10 microM were scored as active and all others as inactive. The activity scores of active compounds were calculated as: Activity Score = 100 x ( 1 - (Ki / Ki_Max) ) In which Ki_Max was 10 microM, the upper Ki threshold for an active test compound. Full sets of curve-fit statistics were reported only for test compounds in which the estimated IC50 was less than 66.7 microM, the highest test compound concentration evaluated. This corresponded to an upper reported Ki limit of 40.3 microM. All other test compounds were reported to have IC50 values greater than 66.7 microM and Ki values greater than 40.3 microM.
