Translocations of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene are frequently found in human leukemias affecting both children and adults. Fusion of MLL to one of more than 60 genes results in generation of oncogenic proteins upregulating Hox genes, which are vital to blood cell development. Patients harboring fusion of the MLL gene suffer from aggressive leukemias and respond poorly to available therapies. All of the oncogenic fusion proteins have a preserved N-terminal fragment of MLL that has been identified to interact with menin. It has been recently discovered that association with menin is critical to the leukemogenic activity of the MLL fusion oncoproteins. Selective targeting of the menin-MLL interaction could provide an attractive therapeutic approach to develop novel drugs for MLL-related leukemias. Small molecules blocking the menin-MLL interaction should reverse the oncogenic potential of MLL fusion proteins. We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization-based assay for the identification of Menin-MLL inhibitors. The assay was run employing two different MLL-derived peptides. The present assay uses a 12 amino acid peptide labeled with fluorescein at its N-terminus. This peptide consists of the menin high affinity binding motif from MLL and is potently bound by menin. Another peptide with a mutated sequence, labeled with Texas Red, was used in parallel as a less stringent screen for inhibitors. The present assay confirms compound activity in a cell-based assay of MLL leukemia cell growth inhibition using three different cell lines: MV4-11 (MLL-AF4), ML-2 (MLL-AF6), and KOPN-8 (MLL-ENL). Inhibition of cell proliferation in the MLL leukemia cells: MV4-11 (MLL-AF4), ML-2 (MLL-AF6) KOPN-8 (MLL-ENL) induced by compound measured after 72h treatment, as detected by the MTT cell viability assay. DMSO vehicle and Staurosporin were used as negative and positive control, respectively, in these experiments. Protocol for MTT assay. Cells were plated in 90 uL of culture medium in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates (Fisher Scientific) at concentrations of 1 x 105/ml. Cells were treated with 0.25% sterile DMSO (Sigma) or serial dilutions of compounds from 20 mM stock solutions in DMSO (all final concentrations of 0.25% DMSO). Cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37C for 72h. A Vybrant MTT cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes) was employed. Plates were read for absorbance at 570 nm using a PHERAstar BMG microplate reader. The experiments were performed in quadruplicate and mean values are reported.
