Disease: Spinal Muscular Atrophy Rationale: Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a pediatric genetic disease that results from homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. Patients have a second gene, SMN2, that is closely related in sequence to SMN1 and encodes the same SMN protein. However, the SMN2 gene is alternatively spliced, producing 30% of the full length mRNA and 70% of am mRNA species that excludes exon 7. Compounds that increase the frequency with which exon 7 is included into the SMN2 mRNA cause a concomitant increase in the level of SMN protein and are of therapeutic value to SMA patients. We developed a 384-well-based high-throughput screen for compounds that correct this splicing defect in the SMN2 gene without affecting splicing of the SMN1 gene. Signal Type: bigger is better Cell Lines: C33A human cervical carcinoma cells (ATCC# HTB-31) were stably transfected with an SMN fragment/luciferase reporter gene construct that incorporates exons 6-8 of SMN1 or SMN2. These cell lines are referred to here as SMN1 and SMN2 cells, respectively. Growth Medium: The growth medium for the SMN1 and SMN2 cells lines was made from Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Sigma F 2442), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ ml streptomycin sulfate and 400mg/L G418 (Geneticin from Gibco, cat. no.11811-031). Assay Medium: The cell culture medium used for the luciferase assay (assay medium) was identical to the growth medium without the G418 selection agent. Assay Reagent: Luciferase assay reagentA single reagent, optimized for signal/cost, was used to lyse the cells and to initiate the luciferase reaction. The assay reagent consists of: 25mM glycylglycine, 15mM magnesium sulfate, 4mM EGTA, adjusted to a pH of 7.85, to which was added 10 M D-luciferin (Sigma L 9504), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Roche Molecular Biochemicals 100034), 2 mM adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP, Sigma A7699), 50 M Coenzyme A, sodium salt (Sigma C 3144) and 1.5% Triton X-100. Screen: incubation of cells with test compoundsFor the luciferase assay, cells were removed from T-175 culture flasks with 3 mL trypsin, quenched with 7 ml assay medium. The cells (~35-40M cells/flask) were spun down and re-suspended in assay medium to a concentration of ~200,000 cells/ml. The cells were immediately seeded with a Zymark SciClone ALH in 384-well assay plates (Nalge Nunc white plates, #164610) 57 L/well for a cell density of 11,000 cells/well. Compounds from the NINDS library were added to reach a final concentration of 10 M (diluted with assay medium by 1000x from the 10 mM stock solution in DMSO). The cells were incubated with the test compounds at 37 degrees C for ~48 hours. A Zymark Sciclone ALH was used for both cell seeding and compound addition. After incubation, the assay plates were cooled to room temperature for ~10-60 minutes. The medium and compounds were aspirated from the wells, followed by 6 rinse/aspirate cycles with a PBS solution. 53 L of the luciferase assay reagent was added and the plate was immediately transferred to a luminescence plate reader. The plate was shaken for 30 seconds prior to reading. The plate processing steps were performed on an integrated Packard Minitrak/Sidetrak. Data Analysis: The dark count background was first subtracted from all luminescence readings. The signal from each compound-treated well was divided the average of 48 control wells on the same 384-well plate. Each compound library plate was tested in triplicate with each of the two cell lines and the entire assay was repeated on two separate occasions, yielding six readings for each compound for each cell line. The highest and lowest of the six normalized readings were dropped and the remaining four readings averaged. These average values of compound-treated luminescence versus control luminescence are denoted Xnorm(y) where X indicates the cell line, SMN1 or SMN2, and y is the compound. The difference of SMN2norm (y)-SMN1norm (y) measures the selective change in SMN2 luciferase expression versus change in SMN1 luciferase production upon treatment with compound y. The is the final score that is output. Dilution Series: 48 compounds were selected for retesting in a two-fold, 20-point dilution series with a maximum concentration of 10 M. These dilutions were created with a Zymark Sciclone ALH Z-8. Once created, the assay was performed as described in the screening section. Concentrations required to achieve 50% of the maximally achievable effect for each compound (EC50) were calculated using Xlfit (IDBS).
