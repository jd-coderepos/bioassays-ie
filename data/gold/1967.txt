Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease was first characterized by Jean-Martin Charcot and Pierre Marie in France and, independently, by Howard Henry Tooth in England in 1886. CMT is one of the most common inherited neurological diseases, affecting about 125,000 Americans. CMT patients typically exhibit muscle atrophy in the extremities and sensory loss. The most common cause of CMT is known as CMT1A, and is caused by a duplication of the PMP22 gene, leading to over-expression of this protein. PMP22 is a glycosylated intrinsic membrane protein accounting for 2-5% of the myelin protein content and over-expression leads to demyelination and subsequently axonal loss. A cell-based assay for PMP22 expression modulation was developed by Drs. Ned Mantei and Ueli Suter on behalf of the CMTA. This assay employs a mouse Schwann cell line, MSC80, that was engineered to have the mouse Pmp22 promoter driving expression of a green light-emitting click beetle luciferase (CBG68; Chroma-Gl developed by Promega Corp).  A red light-emitting click beetle luciferase (CBR; developed by Promega Corp: CBG68 and CBR differ by only  a few amino acids within the D-luciferin binding pocket) under control of the EF-alpha promoter is also stably expressed in the same cells for use as an internal control for nonspecific promoter- or reporter-based effects. Cells were seeded in white solid 1536-well plates at between 500-750 cells/4uL in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, w/o phenol red. After overnight incubation at 37 degree Celsius/5% C02, 23 nL of compounds or DMSO were delivered to each well using a pin tool, followed by 24h-incubation at 37 degree Celsius/5% C02. Then 4 uL Chroma-Glo luminescent substrate mix (Promega) was added to each well. Luminescence was measured on a ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using a 540/25 nm filter for green luminescence and a 618/8 nm filter for red luminescence. The green and red luminescent signals were corrected for red and green luminescence filter overlap using filter calibration constants (determined using control cell lines expressing either the green or red CBLuc reporters). The %Activity was determined from the ratio of corrected green/red luminescent values. Green luminescent and ratio %Activity was determined by normalizing to the signal between of untreated cells (0% Activity) Concentration-response curves were fitted to the signals arising from the green luminescence (PMP22 promoter driven expression) and the red luminescence (control promoter) as well as the calculated ratio. The concentration-effect curves were then classified based on curve quality (r2), response magnitude and degree of measured activity.
