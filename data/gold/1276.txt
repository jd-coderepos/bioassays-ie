Novel reagents that inhibit the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) translation and subsequently the Amyloid beta protein production, that is elevated in Alzheimer's disease, could lead to the discovery of therapeutic drugs for the disease. MLSMR 160K library was screened for small molecules that suppress the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) translation by binding to the 5'Untranslated Region of the APP mRNA. It utilizes a stable neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y transfectants that express Luciferase under the translational control of 146 nucleotides from the 5'UTR of APP mRNA. It had been shown that this region forms a stem loop which is, in turn, a significant regulator of the APP levels in the brain (1, 2). The effects of compounds addition on APP levels is measured by quantification of luciferase expression levels with a bioluminescence assay system. The assay was previously utilized by Jack Rogers for HTS screen of a 110,000 compounds library from the Laboratory for Drug Discovery on Neurodegeneration (LDDN)(3).

Cell Culture - pIRES(APP mRNA 5'UTR) stable transfected SH-SY5Y cells as well as the SH-SY5Y control cells were obtained from Jack T. Rogers as frozen stocks. - The SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 4mM glutamine, and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin. The transfected SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in the same medium that was supplemented with 300ug/ml of geneticin. - To passage cells, the monolayer was washed first with PBS (25 ml) per T175 and the cells detached by incubation with 5ml trypsin/EDTA solution for 6 mn. - Cells were resuspended after the addition of 5 ml growth medium to the T175, transferred to conical 15ml tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 x g - The transfected cells were seeded at dilutions of 1:4. The control SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a dilution of 1:10 or 1:20 and grown until they reached confluency. 2. Cell Seeding for HTS was performed using an 8-channel multi-drop (MTX labs). - Seed 2,000 cells (transfected cells) in 50 ul of media per well of 384-well plate in rows 1 to 23. - Seed 2,000 cells (SHSY-5Y control) in 50 ul of media per well of 384-well plate in row 24 - Incubate overnight (15 h) at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity before addition of compound. 3. Compounds Addition was done using 384-channel pintool. - Add 50 nl of compounds (2 uM final concentration) from compound daughter plates (2 mM in 100 % DMSO) per well of assay plates - Columns 1, 2, 23, 24 are used for controls - Add 50nl of 10mM Cycloheximide (Column 2) per well of assay plate (inhibitor control) - Incubate 48h 37 C, 5% CO2 and humidity - Proceed immediately to luciferase 4.Luciferase assay - Equilibrated plates and all reagents to room temperature for 30 min. - Add 25ul Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay reagent - Incubate for 30min to allow complete cell lysis - Measure luminescence in TECAN infinite PF200
