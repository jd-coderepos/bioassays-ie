Counterscreen assay for S1P4 antagonists: Fluorescence dose response cell-based screening assay for antagonists of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 3 (S1P3). In this assay, a CHO cell line containing human S1P3 and the beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter-gene under control of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) promoter was used to measure S1P3 antagonism by test compound. Stimulation of S1P3 by S1P induces transcription of NFAT-BLA via a G-alpha16 protein coupled signaling cascade, and an increase in BLA activity. BLA activity is measured using a fluorescent BLA substrate. As designed, a compound that acts as a S1P3 antagonist will decrease NFAT-BLA transcription and decrease well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in triplicate using a 10-point, 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal concentration of 25 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v heat inactivated bovine growth serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mg/mL Geneticin, 0.2 mg/mL Hygromycin B, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin. Prior to the start of the assay, cells were suspended at a concentration of 1.25 million/mL in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented as above, except with 0.5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics. The assay was started by dispensing 4 microliters of cell suspension to each well followed by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 and 95% RH. The next day, 25 nL of test compound (5 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO was added to sample wells, and DMSO alone (0.5 % final concentration) was added to High Control wells. Next, S1P prepared in 1% BSA (0.8 micromolar final nominal concentration, corresponding to the EC80 of S1P) was added to the appropriate wells. After 4 hours of incubation, 1 microliter/well of the GeneBLAzer fluorescent substrate mixture, prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and containing 10 mM Probenicid, was added to all wells. The plates were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were read on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Lifesciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 460 nm. Prior to normalization, data were corrected by subtracting "background" for both emission channels (ie, fluorescence values from cell-free wells containing media and substrate only). To normalize assay data, these corrected values were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I460 nm/ I535 nm Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using well fluorescence as follows: % Inhibition = 100 * ( 1 - ( ( (Median_Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound and S1P, Low_Control is defined as wells containing S1P, High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 25 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 25 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50 greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent inhibition value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent inhibition value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores.
