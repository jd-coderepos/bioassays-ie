Counterscreen panel assay for S1P4 antagonists: Ricerca HitProfilingScreen + CYP450. Pandemic influenza represents a significant public health threat, due in part to immune cell-mediated lung tissue damage induced during viral infection. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function. The purpose of this panel of binding assays performed by Ricerca Biosciences, LLC, is to identify a subset of potential receptors, transporters, ion channels, etc. for which the S1P4 antagonist compound SID 87357351 displays affinity. Assays for CYP450, 1A2; CYP450, 2C19; CYP450, 2C9; CYP450, 2D6; and CYP450, 3A4 were enzyme assays using human recombinant insect Sf9 cells with 5 uM 3-cyano-7-ethoxycoumarin as substrate (except for CYP450, 3A4, which used 50 uM 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin as substrate). Detection was based on spectrofluorimetric quantitation of the enzymatic product produced. Assays for the other targets were radioligand binding assays. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The following applies to each panel in this assay: A response of >= 50% inhibition or stimulation is considered "active". Negative inhibition represents a stimulation of binding. List of Reagents: Reagents were provided by Ricerca Biosciences, LLC.
