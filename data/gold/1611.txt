Molecular chaperones including Hsp70 and Hdj1 have been shown to prevent or reverse the cellular toxicity associated with Huntington's Disease and ALS in various model systems. The expression of both genes is regulated by the heat shock response mediated by activation of heat shock transcription factor which binds to the heat shock promoter element. We have performed a secondary screen of the positives emanating from the NINDS primary screen using HeLa cells containing a human Hsp70 promoter fused to the Luciferase reporter construct. Cells were exposed to a range of concentrations from 1 to 10uM in replicate. Screen: Confluent cells were detached from five10cm tissue culture plates with 1ml 1X trypsin and were re-suspended in 500ml assay medium (1:10 dilution). The cells were immediately seeded in 48 well plates (500ul per well) and were grown overnight at 37C. After 12 hrs, selected compounds were added to reach a final concentration of 1uM or 10uM (diluted with assay medium by 1000X from the 10mM stock solution in DMSO). Each plate also contained 5uM of CdCl2 induced and uninduced cells as positive and negative controls, respectively. The cells were incubated with the test compounds at 37C for 12 hours. After incubation, the medium and compounds were aspirated from the wells, followed by 1 rinse/aspirate cycle with 1XPBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution. 200ul of lysis buffer was added to each well and the plates were immediately frozen at -80C until the luciferase assay performed.For the luciferase assay, 100ul of a lysed sample (per well) and 400ul of the reaction buffer was combined in a luminometer tube. Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) was used to add 100ul of the substrate buffer to the lysed-sample/reaction-buffer mixture and read the luciferase activity. Cell Lines: HeLa human cells (ATCC #CCL-2) were stably transfected with heat shock promoter (hsp70 promoter; -188 to +150)/luciferase reporter construct. This cell line is referred to as HSE-HeLa. Growth Medium: The growth medium for HSE-HeLa was Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen #121-0046) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Atlanta Biologicals #S11150), 600ug/ml G418 (Geneticin Invitrogen #11811-031). Cells were grown in 48well plates at 37C. Assay Medium: The assay medium used for drug induction was identical to the growth medium without the G418 selection agent. Assay Buffer: Cells were lysed in 200ul of BLUC (25mM Tris/H3PO4, pH7.8/ 10mM MgCl2 / 1% Triton X-100/ 15% Glycerol/ 1mM EDTA) with 0.5% beta-mercaptoethanol. Assay Reagent: 400ul of BLUC (described above) with 1.25mM ATP was used for each luciferase reaction.Substrate buffer: 100ul of 1mM D-luciferin (Sigma #L-9504) in 1.4mM Tris/H3PO4, pH7.8 was used for each luciferase reaction. Data Analysis: Each compound was tested in triplicate. The mean (Assay_Avg) and the standard deviation (Assay_SD) were calculated using Microsoft Excel software. The fold induction (Assay_Final) was calculated by taking the ratio between the Assay_Avg and the average negative control (uninduced) of the corresponding plate. EC50 (Assay_EC50) was calculated by determining the best fit curve (using the concentrations from the secondary screen) and solving for half-maximum value using Maple statistical software. Detection Reagent: D-luciferin Assay Type: mammalian-cell based Number Replicates: 2 Assay Readout: luminescence Detection Instrument: Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) Concentration Primary Screen: (uM) 1 Concentration Primary Screen: (uM) 10 Number Negative Controls: 52 Negative Control Mean: 900.0 Negative Control Standard Deviation: 321.0 Number Positive Controls: 52 Positive Control Mean: 16278.0 Positive Control Standard Deviation: 7169.0 Secondary screen: 1uM, 3uM, 5uM, 7uM, 10uM, 15uM. Cells were seeded in the 48 well plates as described above. Compounds that tested positive during the primary screen were added to reach a final concentration of 1uM, 3uM, 5uM, 7uM, 10uM, or 15uM (diluted with assay medium by 1000X from the 10mM stock solution in DMSO). Each plate also contained 5uM of CdCl2 induced and uninduced cells as positive and negative controls, respectively. The cells were incubated with the test compounds at 37C for 5 or 12 hours and luciferase activity was measured as described above.Each compound was tested in triplicate.
