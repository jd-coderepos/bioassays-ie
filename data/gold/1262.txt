The purpose of this assay is to confirm activity of a subset of compounds that were identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT1 activation" (PubChem AID 932). The compounds selected for testing in this AID met at least the two following criteria: 1) they were declared active in AID 932; 2) they were declared inactive in a previous set of experiments entitled, "Primary cell-based high throughput screening assay to measure STAT3 activation" (PubChem AID 871). In this assay activation of STAT1 activity was measured using a murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line that stably expresses a STAT1-luciferase construct. Test compounds were screened for their ability to increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1::luciferase reporter activity. Cells were exposed to test compound, followed by treatment with IFN-gamma. Changes in STAT1::luciferase activity were monitored by measuring luminescence. As designed, a STAT1 potentiator will increase IFN-gamma-mediated STAT1 transcription, thus increasing the activation of the luciferase reporter gene, and increasing luminescence. The STAT1 potentiator and antagonist confirmation assays were run simultaneously.  NIH 3T3 cells were grown in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 micrograms/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a density of 1.88 million cells/mL in phenol red-free growth medium, and filtered through a 0.7 micron filter.  Next, 4 ul of cell suspension (7,520 cells per well) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well plates. The assay was started by immediately dispensing 28 nL of test compound (5.7 micromolar final nominal concentration) in DMSO to sample wells, or DMSO (0.6% final concentration) to High Control wells. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  Next, 1 microliter of human recombinant IFN-gamma (final nominal EC80 concentration of 3.0 ng/mL, set as 100% activation) was dispensed to sample and High Control wells.  The plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH).  The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate at room temperature to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.
