TR-FRET-based biochemical high-throughput dose response assay to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization. The purpose of this biochemical assay is to determine dose response curves for test compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, "TR-FRET-based biochemical high-throughput confirmation assay for inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization" (AID 2152). In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged GST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and subsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the Europium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies and energy transfer from Europium to XL-665, leading to inhibition of well FRET. Compounds were tested in quadruplicate in a 10-point 1:3 dilution series starting at a nominal test concentration of 50 micromolar. Protocol Summary: Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of Flag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5 micromolar unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50% inhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of 10-points serial dilutions of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of the incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). All wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM GST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 micromolar and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition controls, respectively. To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = ( I[671nm] / I[617nm] ) x 10,000 Where: I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers. The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows: % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / ( Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 micromolar of unlabelled Core106 protein. For each test compound, percent inhibition was plotted against compound concentration. A four parameter equation describing a sigmoidal dose-response curve was then fitted with adjustable baseline using Assay Explorer software (MDL Information Systems). The reported IC50 values were generated from fitted curves by solving for the X-intercept value at the 50% inhibition level of the Y-intercept value. In cases where the highest concentration tested (i.e. 50 micromolar) did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than 50 micromolar. Compounds with an IC50/ greater than 10 micromolar were considered inactive. Compounds with an IC50 equal to or less than 10 micromolar were considered active. Any compound with a percent activity value <50% at all test concentrations was assigned an activity score of zero. Any compound with a percent activity value >50% at any test concentration was assigned an activity score greater than zero. Activity score was then ranked by the potency, with the most potent compounds assigned the highest activity scores. The activity score range for active compounds is 100-88, for inactive 73-0.
