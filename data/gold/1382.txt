Beta-glucocerebrosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of beta-glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. The inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase results in Gaucher disease, which is characterized by a wide variety of symptoms including hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bony lesions and bone marrow infiltration with characteristic storage cells, known as Gaucher cells. There are also forms of the disorder affecting the central nervous system. Patients with the same genotypes can manifest with diverse clinical presentations and it is believed that improper folding and trafficking of beta-glucocerbrosidase may contribute to the phenotypes observed. Low molecular weight molecules, acting as chaperones, may potentially restore trafficking of misfolded beta-glucocerebrosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomes, thereby enhancing functional lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Using normal beta-glucocerebrosidase, an assay was developed to screen for small molecule inhibitors that could potentially act as molecular chaperones on the mutant forms. A pro-fluorescent substrate was chosen for a screen against a small molecule library. The beta-glucocerebrosidase assay used Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside (Marker Gene Technology Inc.), generating a red fluorescent product. The Km for the Resorufin beta-D-Glucopyranoside was determined to be 71.2 uM. The IC50 values of Conduritol B Epoxide, a known glucocerebrosidase inhibitor, was determined to be 87.5 uM. All compounds were screened in a titration series resulting in AC50s (e.g., IC50s or EC50s). To confirm activity from the original screen, samples were reacquired from MLSCN and also synthesized in-house, and re-screened against the original assay at a higher density of titration points. Both enzyme and substrate were diluted in buffer composed of 50mM citric acid/KH2PO4, 10mM sodium taurocholate and 0.01% tween-20 at pH 5.9. The final concentration of the enzyme was 0.2 nM in both assays. The compound library was titrated in 7 to 15 concentrations for the primary screens with a final concentration ranging from 0.6 nM to 50 uM. This particular assay protocol was performed in 1536-well plate format as follows: Red fluorescence substrate assay: 2 uL enzyme 23 nL compound 1 uL substrate (final concentration of 30 uM) Incubate at room temperature (RT) for 20 minutes Read the plate in Viewlux plate reader (Ex=548(7) and Em=600(10)).
