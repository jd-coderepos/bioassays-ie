Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1). The purpose of this assay is to identify compounds that act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and increase activity of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1; M1) in cells pre-treated with a known agonist. In this assay, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M1 are loaded with the Fluo-8 calcium indicator dye, followed by addition of test compounds and subsequent treatment with the activator acetylcholine at a concentration that results in 20% activation (EC20). As designed, compounds that act as CHRM1 PAMs will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased intracellular calcium and relative fluorescence of the indicator dye beyond that of the EC20 of acetylcholine. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 micromolar. Protocol Summary: The CHO-hM1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 50 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin). The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were transferred to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices) prior to all wells being treated with an EC20 concentration of acetylcholine. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I_Max / I_Min Where: I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added. The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows: % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100 Where: Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine at EC20 and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine (EC100) and DMSO. A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter on an individual plate basis, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the plate based cutoff parameter was declared active. PubChem Activity Outcome and Score: The inactive compounds of this assay have an activity score range of 0 to 78 and the active compounds have an activity score range of 50 to 100. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.
