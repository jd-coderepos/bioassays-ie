Enterococcus faecalis HMGR converts mevalonate and coenzyme A to HMG-CoA using NADP as a cofactor. A product of this reaction, NADPH, absorbs strongly at 340 nm.  The rate of the reaction is measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm with a PerkinElmer Envision microplate reader.  This assay was chosen rather than the HMG-CoA reductase reaction because the substrates, mevalonate and coenzyme A, are less expensive and more stable than HMG-CoA.  NADP is also more stable than NADPH, making this a more robust assay for use in a HTS format.  A kinetic assay was chosen to minimize interference by compounds that absorbed at 340 nm. The purpose of this assay was to screen for compounds that would reduce the observed assay rate, which would in theory be the result of the compound inhibiting the activity of the target enzyme, HMGR. A total of 197,000 compounds were screened at a final concentration of 10 uM. HMG-CoA Reductase Protocol for 384-well HTS Purified recombinant Enterococcus faecalis HMG-CoA reductase. Compound Dosing/Plating: Twenty five nl of compounds in DMSO were dispensed into 384-well clear non-binding surface treated plates. This resulted in concentrations of 10 uM of compound in the assay.  Fifteen uL of HMG-CoA reductase reagent mix which included coenzyme A, NADP, and mevalonate in assay buffer was added to each well of the previously compound dosed 384-well plates.  The reaction was initiated with the addition of 10 uL of HMG-CoA reductase diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the reaction were 2 mM coenzyme A, 4 mM NADP, 4 mM mevalonate, and 15 ug/ml HMG-CoA reductase diluted in assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mM KCl, 2% DMSO and 0.01% Tween 20). The test plate was immediately transferred to a Perkin Elmer Envision microplate reader and absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 16 seconds for 160 seconds. Each plate had 64 control wells in the four outside columns with 32 containing the complete reaction mixture with carrier control (full reaction) and 32 in which the mevalonate had been left out (background).
